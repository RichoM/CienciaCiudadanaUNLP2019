NO,"""My naturesound"" - nature observations with sound recordings","Online systems for observation reporting by citizen scientists have been operating for many years. iNaturalist (California Academy of Sciences 2016), eBird (Cornell Lab of Ornithology 2016) and Observado (Observation International 2016) are well-known international systems, Artportalen (Swedish Species Information Centre 2016) and Artsobservasjoner (Norwegian Biodiversity Information Centre 2016) are Scandinavian. In addition, databases and online solutions exist that are more directly research-oriented but still offer participation by citizen scientists, such as the PlutoF (University of Tartu Natural History Museum 2016) platform. The University of Tartu Natural History Museum maintains the PlutoF platform (Abarenkov et al. 2010) for storing and managing biodiversity data, including taxon observations. In 2014, development was started to integrate an observation app ""Minu loodusheli""/""My naturesound"" (University of Tartu Natural History Museum 2017b) (My naturesound, Fig. 1) within PlutoF system. In 2017, an English language version of the app (University of Tartu Natural History Museum 2017c) was launched that includes nearly all major sound-producing taxon groups in its taxonomy. The application also acts as a practical tool for collecting and publishing occurrence data for the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (Global Biodiversity Information Facility 2017) in standardized Darwin Core format together with download links to the multimedia files. Although the sound recording ability of mobile phones opens new opportunities to validate taxon occurrences, current technological solutions limit the use of recordings in biodiversity research.

The ""My naturesound"" allows the user to record taxon occurrences and to provide audio recordings as evidence. After installing the application, the user is promted to login with PlutoF system credentials or to register with PlutoF. The application is targeted primarely to citizen scientists, but researchers themselves can also use it as a tool for easy annotation of taxon occurrences.

The dataset consists observation data of birds, amphibians and insects by citizen scientists with on site audio recordings. The dataset gives the possibility to analyze the suitablility of mobile devices for recording animal vocalizations and their use in reporting.","- occurrence data

NO,"""The School Differently"" Learning about Marine Protected Areas - A Proactive Educational Approach Towards Implementation of Measures of Marine Habitats Conservation and Protection","On the 5th of May and the 20th of June 2017, the NRDI GeoEcoMar received the visit of students of two elementary schools from Constanţa (“Ciprian Porumbescu” and “Mihail Koiciu”), which dedicated a day of “The school differently” week to awareness-raising and educational activities on marine protected areas. “The school differently” is part of a program developed within the Romanian Program of Education, in 2011. Under the supervision of biologists from NRDI GeoEcoMar, in collaboration with the PhD students from Belgium involved in the PRIDE project, a series of interactive and proactive activities were accomplished, aiming at foster a sense of community and environmental responsibility to the young generation. In total, 30 students of 5th grade, with ages between 11 and 12 years were involved. The children from “Ciprian Porumbescu” School learned how to identify species belonging to the Ponto-Caspian relicts, recognize and understand the negative impact of the invasive species on the Black Sea biodiversity. The children from Mihail Koiciu School, who visited the R/V Mare Nigrum (in custody of the NRDI GeoEcoMar) guided by the ship’s commander and biologists from GeoEcoMar, explored the complicated but interesting domain of marine science, helped by explanations and demonstrations on research work in biology and geochemistry. The feedback received from the children, assessed by help of questionnaires specially conceived for the targeted category of age and activities carried out, is presented in the paper. Judging after children’s reactions and responses to questionnaires, it makes sense to affirm that the activities achieved their scope
and these methods of education and awareness are positively perceived by the children from elementary schools.","- Black Sea marine protected areas

NO,4th European Biodiversity Observation Network (EU BON) Stakeholder Roundtable: Pathways to sustainability for EU BONs network of collaborators and technical infrastructure,"EU BON - Building the European Biodiversity Observation Network (www.eubon.eu) is a project funded under the EU FP7 framework. It presents an innovative approach towards the integration of biodiversity data and information systems, both from in-situ and remote sensing data sources. The aim is to address policy and information needs in a timely manner, customized for various stakeholders on different levels - from local test sites to European and international policy. The Stakeholder Roundtables are a specific task and part of a Work Package in the project (WP6) that focuses on the stakeholder engagement and the science-policy dialogue. The main aim of the Stakeholder Roundtables is to carry out regular engagement with relevant political authorities and other stakeholders at European and national level in support of the delivery of the EU BON project. Furthermore, the Roundtables seek to build up a stakeholder dialogue with exemplar sector-specific user communities to incorporate feedback loops for the products of EU BON (data, tools and models) as well as to develop improvements of existing biodiversity data workflows and to discuss sustainability issues.

The 4th EU BON Stakeholder Roundtable aimed to present current achievements and products of the project EU BON, which can be assigned to three categories: firstly to tools and infrastructure, secondly to the consortium and its network of collaborators and thirdly to (biodiversity) monitoring and scientific forecasting. The last Stakeholder Roundtable - in contrast to the former Roundtables which addressed European policy (Wetzel et al. 2016), citizen science and the EU BON citizen science gateway (Vohland et al. 2016, Runnel et al. 2016) and local research networks (Vohland et al. 2016b) – focused on sustainability issues of the different components of the European biodiversity observation network. The guiding question of the Roundtable was how to achieve sustainability for the products of EU BON after the project will end. It was also discussed what - among the many different products such as tools, software, scientific knowledge, models and infrastructure - are the most essential components of the project for the specific stakeholders (e.g. agencies, citizen science, researchers) and what is needed for the future (adjustments, sustainability for development, funding). One of the central questions was how the essential components could be sustained, by which institutions or networks and how they can be used in the best way for the European and national policy and research needs (e.g. monitoring, reporting) as well as for the global level (e.g. for the Group on Earth Observations, GEO). Finally, and not to forget, another essential aspect was how a European Biodiversity Network as a whole, with its different components, can be further sustained for fulfilling its goals as a central infrastructure for generating biodiversity data and information on a European scale. Here we report the outcomes and discussions of the meeting and also highlight the main messages.","- sustainability

NO,A crowdsourcing approach to collecting photo-based insect and plant observation records,"Scientific field observation by members of the public is known as citizen science and has become popular all across the world. Citizen science is advantageous for collecting large amounts of scientific data and can be seen as a crowdsourcing approach to data collection. Information and communications technology is enhancing the availability of citizen science. Mobile devices, such as mobile phones, that have a digital camera with a global positioning system (GPS) are necessities for contemporary life and can be utilised as powerful observation tools in citizen science.

A  web-based system has been developed as a data collection tool for citizen science. Participants submit an e-mail with a photo taken by their mobile phones. The photos contain location information, which can be easily and automatically embedded if the mobile phone is equipped with GPS. Collaboration has been undertaken with regional event managers, such as museum curators and held citizen science events in each region and for various target taxonomic groups. All photos were stored in the data server and the organisms were taxonomically identified by citizen scientists, regional managers and the authors.

Research Institute for Nature and Forest

(INBO) in cooperation with the Butterfly working group of Natuurpunt (Vlinderwerkgroep). It is derived from the database Vlinderdatabank at the INBO, which consists of (historical) collection and literature data (1830-2001), for which all butterfly specimens in institutional and available personal collections were digitized and all entomological and other relevant publications were checked for butterfly distribution data. It also contains observations and monitoring data for the period 1991-2014. The latter type were collected by a (small) butterfly monitoring network where butterflies were recorded using a standardized protocol. The second dataset (further referred to as the Natuurpunt dataset – http://doi.org/10.15468/ezfbee) contains 612,934 records of 63 species and is derived from the database http://waarnemingen.be, hosted at the nature conservation NGO Natuurpunt in collaboration with Stichting Natuurinformatie.

NO,A decade of the India Biodiversity Portal: Planning ahead with technology to enhance citizen science participation in India,"The India Biodiversity Portal (IBP) was initiated a decade ago, aiming to aggregate data on all species within India. The portal has been running a citizen science module for the past 8 years, aggregating observation data from the general public. The portal runs many flagship citizen science campaigns, such as the Neighborhood Trees Campaign, National Moth Week, Spotting Alien Invasive species, Mapping Indian Snails and Slugs and Frogwatch. We have learnt valuable lessons in harnessing participation in citizen science, implementing functionality and in integrating technological advancements into the platform codebase. Following up on these, we are implementing new features that will streamline development, entice users and further spur participation. We discuss some of the proposed changes and our justification, including the impacts we expect in generating better citizen science data.

A key lesson arising out of our campaigns in remote regions of India, where internet penetration is relatively new, is that most users are connected to the web exclusively through a mobile device. Most do not have access to a personal computer or an email account. Yet they are internet savvy and use mobile applications to accomplish complex tasks such as banking activities, often logging in and being authenticated exclusively through a mobile number. We are implementing short-messaging-service (SMS) or one-time password-based login mechanisms, for login even without an email account for authentication. Although many initiatives have been investing in platform-specific mobile apps to cater to a growing mobile user community, maintaining and updating multiple mobile apps alongside enhancements to the web version is a resource-intensive task that most platforms cannot afford. Inconsistency in functions and usability across different versions of the same platform may lead to gaps in data collection. To address this challenge and streamline development, we have begun updating the portal codebase to enable Progressive Web Apps, which will replace conventional mobile applications while also serving as Single Page Applications that provide a unified experience across device platforms and alleviating the need for updating mobile apps separately.

For existing contributors on the portal, comparisons of their contributions against other users are a motivating factor to contribute further. Leaderboards and reputation systems are proven methods to promote activity and provide recognition to participants. Such leaderboards also incentivise newer participants to emulate leaders and climb the boards. We are building a reputation system that not only recognizes quantity but also the quality of the user's contribution. In addition, we are working on integrating intelligent push notification technology that will constantly engage users by keeping them abreast of activity related to content reflecting their interest on the portal. These features are expected to engage contributors and keep them motivated towards further data contributions.

Finally, the most rewarding outcome from contributing citizen science data is in visualizing its impact. The most obvious are improvements in species distribution maps that are generated for each species page on the portal. Users are greatly motivated by contributing data that may enhance known distributions and may constitute range extensions for a species. Distribution maps on the portal are being revamped so that information is presented to the user in real-time through visualisations that are are both attractive and easy to interpret. These will provide users with gratification and help spur participation further.

IBP is also instituting the ability to automate the classification of its data to identify publication-grade data. Through a combination of user's reputation and other data quality criteria, the data on IBP will be automatically graded, allowing such data to be pushed to Global Biodiversity Information Facility on a periodic basis as a Darwin Core Archive, contributing to global biodiversity data.","- citizen science

NO,A Family Cars- Life Cycle Cost (LCC)-Oriented Hybrid Modelling Approach Combining ANN and CBR,"Design for cost (DFC) is a method that reduces life cycle cost (LCC) from the angle of designers. Multiple domain features mapping (MDFM) methodology was given in DFC. Using MDFM, we can use design features to estimate the LCC. From the angle of DFC, the design features of family cars were obtained, such as all dimensions, engine power and emission volume. At the conceptual design stage, cars- LCC were estimated using back propagation (BP) artificial neural networks (ANN) method and case-based reasoning (CBR). Hamming space was used to measure the similarity among cases in CBR method. Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm and genetic algorithm (GA) were used in ANN. The differences of LCC estimation model between CBR and artificial neural networks (ANN) were provided. ANN and CBR separately each method has its shortcomings. By combining ANN and CBR improved results accuracy was obtained. Firstly, using ANN selected some design features that affect LCC. Then using LCC estimation results of ANN could raise the accuracy of LCC estimation in CBR method. Thirdly, using ANN estimate LCC errors and correct errors in CBR-s estimation results if the accuracy is not enough accurate. Finally, economically family cars and sport utility vehicle (SUV) was given as LCC estimation cases using this hybrid approach combining ANN and CBR.","- case-based reasoning

NO,A fork in the alphabet soup: DoeDat a multilingual crowdsourcing platform,"Specimen labels are written in numerous languages and accurate interpretation requires local knowledge of place names, vernacular names and people's names. In many countries more than one language is in common usage. Belgium, for example, has three official languages. Crowdsourcing has helped many collections digitize their labels and generates useful data for science. Furthermore, direct engagement of the public with a herbarium increases the collection's visibility and potentially reinforces a sense of common ownership. For these reasons we built DoeDat, a multilingual crowdsourcing platform forked from Digivol of the Australian Museum (Figs 1, 2). Some of the useful features we inherited from Digivol include a georeferencing tool, configurable templates, simple project management and individual institutional branding.

Running a multilingual website does increase the work needed to setup and manage projects, but we hope to gain from the broader engagement we can attract. Currently, we are focusing our work on Belgian collections were Dutch and French are the primary languages, but in the future we may expand our languages when we work on our international collections. We also hope that we can eventually merge our code with that of Digivol, so that we can both benefit from each other's developments.","- public engagement

Citizens can also gain a better understanding of scientific concepts and methods. Additionally, citizens can help scientists better understand and address issues of concern to their families and communities. However, citizen science also raises ethical issues that should be addressed when projects begin and throughout the course of scientific investigation. To promote ethical research, scientists should develop guidelines for involvement of citizens in research, communicate effectively with participants and local communities at the outset of their involvement in research projects, carefully oversee their work, develop appropriate publication practices, and provide lay-volunteers with education and training on the responsible conduct of research. Researchers also need to be cognizant of clarifying these roles and responsibilities as well as promoting appropriate and safe citizen participation and transparency of the study methods, data analysis, and communication of results.",,publication,Journal article,article,2015-06-06,,1258926,10.1016/j.envsci.2015.05.008,1258927,"- Resnik, David B.

NO,A Multi-platform Mobile Application to Collect Citizen Science Data for Bignoniaceae Phenological Research,"The implementation of Citizen Science in biodiversity studies has led the general public to engage in environmental actions and to contribute to the conservation of natural resources (Chandler et al. 2017). Smartphones have become part of the daily lives of millions of people, allowing the general public to collect data and conduct automatic measurements at a very low cost. Indeed, a series of Citizen Science mobile applications have allowed citizens to rapidly record specimen observations and contribute for the development of large biodiversity databases around the World. Citizen Science applications have a multitude of purposes, as well as target a variety of taxa, biological questions and geographical regions.

Brazil is a megadiverse country that includes many threatened species and Biomes. Conversation efforts are urgent and the engagement of the civil society is critical. Brazilian dry and wet forests are dominated by members of the plant family Bignoniaceae, all of which are characterized by beautiful trumpet-shaped flowers and a big-bang flowering strategy. Species of the Neotropical Bignoniaceae trees are popularly known in Brazil as ""Ipê"" and are broadly cultivated throughout the country due to the showy flowers and strong wood. Different species have different flower colors, making its identification relatively easy. The showy and colorful flowers are extremely admired by the local population and the media. Flowering of ""Ipês"" is triggered by dry climate, lower temperatures and increasing day-light, making this group an excellent model for phenological and climatic studies involving Citizen Science.

Here, we developed a multi-platform mobile application focused on the plant family Bignoniaceae that allows users to contribute phenological data for species from this plant family. More specifically, through this application the user is able to provide data about specimen locations, phenology and date, all of which can be validated by a photograph. This platform is based on React Native, a hybrid app framework that helps the developers to reuse the code across multiple mobile platforms, a development much more efficient and with efforts focused on the user experience. This technology uses Javascript as programming language and Facebook React as a basis for development. The system is similar to other CS apps such as iNaturalist. Namely, the overall observations improve the quality of the ranking through positive feedback from the community, strengthening the network of interactions between users and encouraging active participation. On the other hand, the application allows users to access all previously stored observations, which, in turn, can suggest improvements to that particular observation. Furthermore, observations without a correct ID can be stored until others can suggest a correct identification, maximizing the value of individual observations and data gathered.

An important aspect of this mobile application is the participation of a network of experts on this plant family, allowing a rapid and accurate verification of individual observations. This team of Bignoniaceae experts is also able to make full use of the data gathered by correlating climate and phenological patterns. Results from these analyses are provided to the citizens gathering the data which will, in turn, stimulate the collection of new data, especially in poorly sampled locations. This is a very dynamic mobile application, that aims to engage the civil society with true scientific research, stimulating the management of natural resources and conservation efforts. Through this mobile app, we hope to engage the general public into biodiversity studies by improving their knowledge on an iconic group of Brazilian plants, while contributing data for scientific studies. The system is expected to be released in May and will be available at ipesdobrasil.org.br.","- Citizen Science

NO,A Review of the Capacity for OpenStreetMap Software in Humanitarian Disaster Response: A Case Study Investigating the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team Response to the 2015 Nepalese Earthquake,"Citizen science includes networks of ordinary people acting as sensors, observing and recording information for science. The Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) is one such sensor network working to empower citizens to collaboratively produce a global picture from free geographic information. The success of such open source software is extended by the development of freely used open databases for the user community. Participating citizens do not require a high level of skill. Final results are processed by professionals following quality assurance protocols before map information is released. ","- Nepalese Earthquake, OpenStreetMap, sensors",publication,Journal article,article,2017-03-15,,790139,10.5281/zenodo.399298,399298,"- Rieger, Courtney",

NO,"A scaling down mapping of Pinna nobilis (Linnaeus, 1758) through the combination of scientific literature, NATURA 2000, grey literature and citizen science data","This research investigates the occurrence of Pinna nobilis (Linnaeus, 1758) in the Mediterranean Sea, where it is an endemic and the largest bivalve species. Such a species is protected under the European Council Directive 92/43/EEC since 1992, being exposed to anthropogenic impacts. The distribution of this species has been known, in the past, only from reports in scientific literature. Presently, the concerns, threats and risks for P. nobilis are increasing and a more detailed mapping of the actual distribution from a largest to a local spatial scale is essential for the implementation of monitoring, management and conservation actions. Here we provide a systematic review on the occurrence of P. nobilis, employing and combining different sources of information, such as scientific and grey literature, NATURA 2000 geodata and citizen science records. The methodological approach is a pilot test based on a scaling down of the geographical area of study, from the whole of the Mediterranean Sea to the Italian and Apulian coastline (South-East Italy); accordingly, the above mentioned sources of data have been gradually included. The results show that the combination of multiple sources of information provide a more exact determination of the species distribution at a local scale, identifying sites where in-depth actions are required to ensure the species conservation and restoration. Also, the IUCN has recently underlined that the conservation of P. nobilis has become a difficult challenge, so that each of the spatial scales for the investigation is crucial to enable a better preservation and conservation of the species in the Mediterranean Sea.","- Pen shell

Embodying this design approach, the Monome OSC/MIDI USB controller represents a minimalist, open-source hardware device. The open-source nature of the device has allowed for a small group of Monome users to modify the hardware, firmware, and software associated with the interface. These user driven modifications have allowed the re-imagining of the interface for new and novel purposes, beyond even that of the device's original intentions. With development being driven by a community of users, a device can become several related but unique generations of musical controllers, each one focused on a specific set of needs.",,publication,Conference paper,conferencepaper,2010-06-01,10.5281/zenodo.1177918,1177918,10.5281/zenodo.1177919,1177919,"- Vallis, Owen

NO,A three-pronged strategy to improve trust in biodiversity data produced by citizen science programs,"The quality of data produced by citizen science (CS) programs has been called into question by academic scientists, governments, and corporations. Their doubts arise because they perceive CS groups as intruding on the rightful opportunities of standard science and industry organizations, because of a normal skepticism of novel approaches, and because of a lack of understanding of how CS produces data.

I propose a three-pronged strategy to overcome these objections and improve trust in CS data.

Develop methods for CS programs to advertise their efforts in data quality control and quality assurance (QCQA). As a first step the PPSR core could incorporate a field that would allow programs to point to webpages that document the QAQC practices of each program. It is my experience that many programs think carefully about data quality, but the CS community currently lacks an established protocol to share this information. Define and implement best practices for generating biodiversity data using different methods. Wiggins et al. 2011 published a list of approaches that can be used for QCQA in CS projects but how these approaches should be implemented has not been systematically investigated. Measure and report data quality. If one takes the point of view that citizen science is akin to a new category of scientific instruments, then the ideas of instrument measurement and calibration can be applied CS. Scientists are well aware that any instrument needs to be calibrated before its efficacy can be established. However, because CS is new approach, the specific procedures needed for different kinds of programs are just now being worked out for the first time.

The strategy outlined above faces some specific challenges. Citizen science biodiversity programs must address two important problems that standard scientific entities encounter when sampling and monitoring biodiversity. The first is correctly identifying species. For citizens this can be a problem because they often do not have the training and background of scientist teams. Likewise, it may be difficult for CS projects to manage updating and maintaining the taxonomies of the species being investigated. A second set of challenges is the diverse kinds of biodiversity data collected by CS programs. For instances, Notes from Nature decodes that labels of museum specimens, Snapshot Serengeti identifies species of large mammals from camera trap photographs, iNaturalist collections images of species and then has a crowdsource identification processs, while eBird collects observations of birds that are immediately filtered with computer algorithms for review by the observer and if, subsequently flagged, reviewed by a local expert. Each of these programs likely requires a different set of best practices and methods to measure data quality.","- citizen science

NO,Advancing Citizen Science for Coastal and Ocean Research,"In Citizen Science, members of the general public collaborate with scientists to generate and use data relating to the natural world. For the many fields of marine research, this is a particularly powerful approach which should not be overlooked. The sheer scale of coastal and ocean environments mean that it would take several lifetimes for scientists to study them alone. By collaborating with citizens, a much greater number of people can be mobilized to gather a wealth of data and develop new scientific knowledge and understanding. The variety of data types which are amenable to Citizen Science, as outlined in the position paper, are great, meaning that there could be a project to suit everyone. Citizen Science can also enable participants to improve their Ocean Literacy, gain new skills and experiences, and can also empower them to participate in the process of delivering future marine policy.

Now, more than ever, marine science research is needed to understand the impacts of a world undergoing change. The rise of Marine Citizen Science to help address this need is therefore timely. This paper highlights opportunities, challenges and best practice in Marine Citizen Science, and sets out a list of high-level strategic recommendations for the future development of Marine Citizen Science in Europe. It presents examples of existing Marine Citizen Science initiatives in Europe to illustrate good practice. Common concerns such as data quality and maintaining engagement are discussed, as are future opportunities such as increased use of technology and potential role of Marine Citizen Science in informing marine policy and conservation. The paper closes with a list of high-level strategic recommendations for the future development of Marine Citizen Science in Europe.",,publication,Report,report,2017-05-18,10.5281/zenodo.3338093,3338093,10.5281/zenodo.3338094,3338094,"- Garcia-Soto, Carlos

NO,An alliance for biodiversity knowledge: Rethinking international collaboration in biodiversity informatics,"There has been major progress over the last two decades in digitising historical knowledge of biodiversity and in making biodiversity data freely and openly accessible. Interlocking efforts bring together international partnerships and networks, national, regional and institutional projects and investments and countless individual contributors, spanning diverse biological and environmental research domains, government agencies and non-governmental organisations, citizen science and commercial enterprise. However, current efforts remain inefficient and inadequate to address the global need for accurate data on the world's species and on changing patterns and trends in biodiversity. Significant challenges include imbalances in regional engagement in biodiversity informatics activity, uneven progress in data mobilisation and sharing, the lack of stable persistent identifiers for data records, redundant and incompatible processes for cleaning and interpreting data and the absence of functional mechanisms for knowledgeable experts to curate and improve data.

The first Global Biodiversity Informatics Conference (GBIC) in 2012 delivered the Global Biodiversity Informatics Outlook (GBIO, Hobern et al. 2012), an architectural vision for the major components of a distributed global infrastructure for biodiiversity information, but realigning the work of existing organisations and projects to achieve this vision remains challenging. Recognising the need for greater alignment between efforts at all scales, the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) convened the second Global Biodiversity Informatics Conference (GBIC2) in July 2018 to propose a coordination mechanism for developing shared roadmaps for biodiversity informatics. GBIC2 attendees reached consensus on the need for a global alliance for biodiversity knowledge, learning from examples such as the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) and the open software communities under the Apache Software Foundation. These initiatives provide models for multiple stakeholders with decentralised funding and independent governance to combine resources and develop sustainable solutions that address common needs.

GBIF was asked to coordinate next steps following GBIC2, including publication of a paper, Connecting data and expertise: a new alliance for biodiversity knowledge (Hobern et al. 2019). The supplementary materials for the paper include PDF brochures explaining the concept in eleven languages. During 2019, GBIF is coordinating further consultations to establish an optimal model for the governance and operations of the alliance and to advance collaboration around some of the major building blocks of the GBIO. Collaboration at this scale, and across all aspects of biodiversity information, is essential for effective delivery of important information products such as the Essential Biodiversity Variables and the planned pan-European natural history collections infrastructure, DiSSCo.

This presentation explains the goals for this alliance and updates on progress during 2019 in operationalising the concept.","- alliance for biodiversity knowledge

NO,"An atlas of orchids distribution in the Campania region (Italy), a citizen science project for the most charming plant family","A database of the orchids of Campania has been built up since 2000 with data collected for academic purposes, research projects and, more recently, with the contributions of enthusiastic amateurs and scholars, thus becoming a real citizen science project leading to the realization of an online Atlas (http://www.floracampana.unina.it/Orchidee/index.html). In this paper, the collection and storage of the data and the synthesis of them are presented. On 31 December 2016, the database accounted for 14680 records from more than 30 contributors relating to 126 taxonomic entities (species, subspecies, hybrids and a few ""sensu lato""). The bibliographic records number 3663 (24.9%) and cover a time range of four centuries (from 1616 to 2016). Amongst the 11017 field records (observations), more than 99% are geo-referred and are ""punctual"" type (precision less than 100 m). The spatial and temporal distribution of the data has been analysed and biases have been underlined. The observations show a clear difference in the study effort year by year but always with a significant contribution of the citizen scientists. The analysis of the spatial distribution shows that the observations are preferably collected in protected areas, around main roads and on the roadsides. Many cells of the grid still lack information and these should be the object of future research.","- Orchidaceae

NO,An Evaluation of In-house versus Out-sourced Data Capture at the Meise Botanic Garden (BR),"There are many ways to capture data from herbarium specimen labels. Here we compare the results of in-house verses out-sourced data transcription with the aim of evaluating the pros and cons of each approach and guiding future projects that want to do the same.

In 2014 Meise Botanic Garden (BR) embarked on a mass digitization project. We digitally imaged of some 1.2 million herbarium specimens from our African and Belgian Herbaria. The minimal data for a third of these images was transcribed in-house, while the remainder was out-sourced to a commercial company. The minimal data comprised the fields: specimen's herbarium location, barcode, filing name, family, collector, collector number, country code and phytoregion (for the Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda & Burundi). The out-sourced data capture consisted of three types:

additional label information for central African specimens having minimal data; complete data for the remaining African specimens; and, species filing name information for African and Belgian specimens without minimal data. As part of the preparation for out-sourcing, a strict protocol had to be established as to the criteria for acceptable data quality levels.

Also, the creation of several lookup tables for data entry was necessary to improve data quality. During the start-up phase all the data were checked, feedback given, compromises made and the protocol amended. After this phase, an agreed upon subsample was quality controlled. If the error score exceeded the agreed level, the batch was returned for retyping. The data had three quality control checks during the process, by the data capturers, the contractor's project managers and ourselves.

Data quality was analysed and compared in-house versus out-sourced modes of data capture. The error rate by our staff versus the external company was comparable. The types of error that occurred were often linked to the specific field in question. These errors include problems of interpretation, legibility, foreign languages, typographic errors, etc. A significant amount of data cleaning and post-capture processing was required prior to import into our database, despite the data being of good quality according to protocol (error < 1%). By improving the workflow and field definitions a notable improvement could be made in the ""data cleaning"" phase.

The initial motivation for capturing some data in-house was financial. However, after analysis, this may not have been the most cost effective approach. Many lessons have been learned from this first mass digitisation project that will implemented in similar projects in the future.","- mass digitisation

NO,An Integrated Data Quality System for Species Observations,"Species-level observational data comprise the largest and fastest-growing part of the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). The largest single contributor of species observations is eBird, which so far has contributed more than 361 million records to GBIF. eBird engages a vast network of human observers (citizen-scientists) to report bird observations, with the goal of estimating the range, abundance, habitat preferences, and trends of bird species at high spatial and temporal resolutions across each species' entire life-cycle.  Since its inception, eBird has focused on improving the data quality of its observations, primarily focused in two areas:

ensuring that participants describe how they gathered their observations and, all observations are reviewed for accuracy.

In this presentation I will review how this is done in eBird.

Standardized Data Collection. eBird gathers bird observations based on how bird watchers typically observe birds with units of data collection being ""checklists"" of zero or more species including a count of individuals for each species observed.  Participants choose the location where they made their observations and submit their checklists via Mobile Apps (50% of all submissions) or the website (50% of all submissions). All checklists are submitted in a standard format identifying where, how, and with whom they made their observations. Mobile apps precisely record locations, the track taken, and the distance they traveled while making the observations. The start time and duration of surveys are also recorded. All observers must report whether they reported all the birds they detected and identified, which allows analysts to infer absence of birds if they were not reported. All data are stored within an Oracle data management framework.

Data Accuracy. The most significant data quality challenge for species observations is detecting and correctly identifying organisms to species. The issue involves how to handle both false positives — the misidentification of an observed organism, and false negatives—failing to report a species that was present. The most egregious false positives can be identified as anomalies that fall outside the norm of occurrence for a species at a particular time or space. However, false positives can also be misidentifications of common species.  These challenges are addressed by:

Data-driven filters.  eBird's existing data can identify and flag potentially erroneous records at increasingly fine spatial, temporal, and user-specific scales. These filters can identify outliers and likely errors, which are the foundation of the eBird review process. By using the vetted data to identify outliers, data quality checks run against expected occurrence probabilities at very fine scales and identify anomalies during data submission (including on mobile devices). Incorporate observer expertise scores. Observer differences are the largest source of variability in eBird data. Assessment of observer metrics, and the inclusion of these data in species distribution models, improves analysis output and model performance. Expert reviewer network. More than 2000 volunteers review records identified by the data-driven filters and contact data submitters to confirm their observations. The existing data quality process functions globally. Currently the approach is focused on misidentified birds, but in the future will also involve collection event issues (e.g., issues with protocol, location, or methodology), sensitive species, exotic species, and better handle widely-observed individual rarities. Additional tools are also to be developed to help editors improve efficiency and better prioritize review.

In 2017, 4,107,757 observations representing 4.6% of all eBird records submitted were flagged for review by the data driven filters. Of these records 57.4% were validated and 42.6% were invalidated.","- Data quality

NO,Analyses of occurrence data of protected insect species collected by citizens in Italy,"Citizen science, the engagement of people in a research project, has grown rapidly in recent years, also for mapping of species of conservation interest. The Life Project ""Monitoring Insects with Public Participation"" (MIPP) actively promoted collaboration amongst scientists, public administrations and citizens in the collection of occurrence data of nine insect species listed in the Habitats Directive: Lucanus cervus, Osmoderma eremita, Cerambyx cerdo, Rosalia alpina, Morimus asper/funereus, Lopinga achine, Parnassius apollo, Zerynthia cassandra/polyxena and Saga pedo. These species were selected because they share two main characteristics: (i) they are listed in Annexes II and IV of the Habitats Directive and (ii) they are large and relatively easy to identify. From 2014 to 2016, many different strategies were applied to contact and engage the public and approximately 14,000 citizens were reached directly. Additionally, printed and online material informed the public about this project. Citizens could transmit data on the target species, accompanied by a photograph, via the web-site of the project or through a dedicated application (app) for smartphones and tablets. All records were validated by experts based on the photographs sent by citizens. A total number of 2,308 records were transmitted and 1,691 (73.2%) of these were confirmed. Most of the reports were submitted via the website, although the submission via the app increased over time. The species most commonly recorded was L. cervus, followed by M. asper/funereus and R. alpina. Data collected by citizen scientists allowed a detailed analysis to be made on altitudinal distribution and phenology of the species and the results obtained were compared with literature data on altitudinal distribution and phenology. For example, for L. cervus, 67% of the records collected were from the altitudinal range 0–400 m a.s.l. Interestingly, the data showed that the phenology of this species changed with altitude.","- Citizen Science

NO,Appraisal of Energy Efficiency of Urban Development Plans: The Fidelity Concept on Izmir-Balcova Case,"Design and land use are closely linked to the energy efficiency levels for an urban area. The current city planning practice does not involve an effective land useenergy evaluation in its 'blueprint' urban plans. The study proposed an appraisal method that can be embedded in GIS programs using five planning criteria as how far a planner can give away from the planning principles (criteria) for the most energy output s/he can obtain. The case of Balcova, a district in the Izmir Metropolitan area, is used conformingly for evaluating the proposed master plan and the geothermal energy (heating only) use for the concern district. If the land use design were proposed accordingly at-most energy efficiency (a 30% obtained), mainly increasing the density around the geothermal wells and also proposing more mixed use zones, we could have 17% distortion (infidelity to the main planning principles) from the original plan. The proposed method can be an effective tool for planners as simulation media, of which calculations can be made by GIS ready tools, to evaluate efficiency levels for different plan proposals, letting to know how much energy saving causes how much deviation from the other planning ideals. Lower energy uses can be possible for different land use proposals for various policy trials.",,publication,Journal article,article,2008-12-23,10.5281/zenodo.1329177,1329177,10.5281/zenodo.1329178,1329178,"- Y.

NO,Appropriate Technology: Revisiting the Movement in Developing Countries for Sustainability,"The economic growth of any nation is steered and dependent on innovation in technology. It can be preferably argued that technology has enhanced the quality of life. Technology is linked both with an economic and a social structure. But there are some parts of the world or communities which are yet to reap the benefits of technological innovation. Business and organizations are now well equipped with cutting-edge innovations that improve the firm performance and provide them with a competitive edge, but rarely does it have a positive impact on any community which is weak and marginalized. In recent times, it is observed that communities are actively handling social or ecological issues with the help of indigenous technologies. Thus, ""Appropriate Technology"" comes into the discussion, which is quite prevalent in the rural third world. Appropriate technology grew as a movement in the mid-1970s during the energy crisis, but it lost its stance in the following years when people started it to describe it as an inferior technology or dead technology. Basically, there is no such technology which is inferior or sophisticated for a particular region. The relevance of appropriate technology lies in penetrating technology into a larger and weaker section of community where the “Bottom of the pyramid” can pay for technology if they find the price is affordable. This is a theoretical paper which primarily revolves around how appropriate technology has faded and again evolved in both developed and developing countries. The paper will try to focus on the various concepts, history and challenges faced by the appropriate technology over the years. Appropriate technology follows a documented approach but lags in overall design and diffusion. Diffusion of technology into the poorer sections of community remains unanswered until the present time. Appropriate technology is multi-disciplinary in nature; therefore, this openness allows having a varied working model for different problems. Appropriate technology is a friendly technology that seeks to improve the lives of people in a constraint environment by providing an affordable and sustainable solution. Appropriate technology needs to be defined in the era of modern technological advancement for sustainability.","- Appropriate technology

NO,Automated Identification of Citizen Science Observations for Ecological Studies,"Pl@ntNet is an international initiative which was the first one attempting to combine the force of citizens networks with automated identification tools based on machine learning technologies (Joly et al. 2014). Launched in 2009 by a consortium involving research institutes in computer sciences, ecology and agriculture, it was the starting point of several scientific and technological productions (Goëau et al. 2012) which finally led to the first release of the Pl@ntNet app (iOS in February 2013 (Goëau et al. 2013) and Android (Goëau et al. 2014) the following year). Initially based on 800 plant species, the app was progressively enlarged to thousands of species of the European, North American and tropical regions. Nowadays, the app covers more than 15 000 species and is adapted to 22 regional and thematic contexts, such as the Andean plant species, the wild salads of southern Europe, the indigenous trees species of South Africa, the flora of the Indian Ocean Islands, the New Caledonian Flora, etc. The app is translated in 11 languages and is being used by more than 3 millions of end-users all over the world, mostly in Europe and the US.

The analysis of the data collected by Pl@ntnet users, which represent more than 24 millions of observations up to now, has a high potential for different ecological and management questions. A recent work (Botella et al. 2018), in particular, did show that the stream of Pl@ntNet observations could allow a fine-grained and regular monitoring of some species of interest such as invasive ones. However, this requires cautious considerations about the contexts in which the application is used. In this talk, we will synthesize the results of this study and present another one related to phenology. Indeed, as the phenological stage of the observed plants is also recorded, these data offer a rich and unique material for phenological studies at large geographical or taxonomical scale. We will share preliminary results obtained on some important pantropical species (such as the Melia azedarach L., and the Lantana camara L.), for which we have detected significant intercontinental phenological patterns, among the project data.","- Citizen science

NO,Badania faunistyczne nad lądowymi pluskwiakami różnoskrzydłymi (Hemiptera: Heteroptera) w Polsce: rys historyczny i perspektywy [Faunistic researches on terrestrial true-bugs (Hemiptera: Heteroptera) in Poland: a historical background and perspectives],"This paper presents the history of research on terrestrial true-bugs (Hemiptera: Heteroptera) in Poland, the current state of knowledge and perspectives in future faunistic studies in our country. Cimex lectularius was the first species of Heteroptera recorded from the present territory of Poland; it was listed in „Theriotropheum Silesiae” by Caspar Schwenkfeld (1603) from Silesia. In the XIXth century the number of Heteroptera species records from the present territory of Poland increased rapidly, mainly due to the faunistic studies by both, German (Weigel 1806; Schilling 1827, 1837; Gravenhorst 1836; Siebold 1839; Scholtz 1847; Schramm 1848; Assmann 1854) and Polish (Gorski 1852; Waga 1857; Nowicki 1864, 1865, 1867, 1868, 1870a, b; Łomnicki 1882; Stobiecki 1883; Kotula 1890) entomologists. Till the end of the XIXth century, 438 species of terrestrial Heteroptera have been recorded from the present territory of Poland; all those records are presented in the Fig. 1. In the first half of the twentieth century, faunistic studies on the terrestrial Heteroptera in Poland have also been conducted predominantly by German entomologists (Kuhlgatz 1901, Enderlein 1906, Stichel 1923, Laske 1928, Schmidt 1928, Gruhl 1929, Scholz 1931, Schubert 1934, Karl 1935, Engel i Hedicke 1936, Michalk 1936, Pax 1937, Lanzke i Polentz 1942), but papers by the Polish authors have also been published (Smreczyński 1906, Szulczewski 1908, Stobiecki 1915, Krasucki 1916, Tenenbaum 1921, Strawiński 1926, Ruszkowski 1933, Obarski 1938). Till 1945 the number of Heteroptera species recorded from the present territory of Poland increased to 578 with many new records from the regions not studied before (Fig. 2). In the second half of the XXth century the first keys for the identification of Polish Heteroptera (Wróblewski 1968; Cmoluchowa 1978), and the first comprehensive faunistic reviews of several true-bugs families (Lis J.A. 1990a, b) have been published what had a great impact on further development of faunistic studies in Poland. The XXth century has ended with 673 species of terrestrial Heteroptera recorded from Poland, and the number of known Polish records has doubled in comparison to the year 1945 (till that year we have about 9 800 records, whereas till the end of the XXth century – about 18 400 records: see Fig. 3 and Fig. 5). The beginning of the XXI century brings the data growth of further 11 000 records (Fig. 4) and several species recorded in our country for the first time (Fig. 6). At present, the best investigated regions are, as follows: several cities and their surroundings (Cracow, Wrocław, Bytom, Poznań, Przemyśl, Zwierzyniec, Puławy), Białowieża Primeval Forest, Ojców National Park, Pieniny Mountains, Gorce Mountains, Bukowa Góra reserve, and Bielinek on the Odra River reserve (Fig. 7). However, only 3% of the territory of Poland are very well studied, since only in 82 UTM squares (out of almost 3400) at least 100 Heteroptera species have been recorded, so far. Moreover, at least one species has been recorded in 1200 UTM squares (it is about one third of the Polish UTM squares). Although faunistic studies are very important from many points of view and are the basis for zoocenology, zoogeography, or phylogeography, their traditions in Poland are not as well established as in other European countries. Comprehensive nature of such studies, including a necessity of involving many specialists and the lack of time and resources to cover the entire country area, makes them not very popular in Poland. Therefore, the citizen science initiatives in Polish Heteroptera defined as “the collection and analysis of data by non-professional entomologists as part of a collaborative project with professional scientists” would be a great opportunity to gather more new faunistic data from our country. Moreover, the citizen science would be also very important in early detection of alien Heteroptera pest species introduced to our country.","- Hemiptera

,Belgian baseline distribution of invasive alien species of Union concern (Regulation (EU) 1143/2014),"Aims and scope

The European Alien Species Information Network team (EASIN, http://easin.jrc.ec.europa.eu) of the Joint Research Centre (JRC) requests the European member states to provide and verify the baseline distribution data of invasive alien species of Union Concern (Tsiamis et al. 2017) as provided by the EASIN mapping system (Katsanevakis et al. 2012). These are species with documented biodiversity impacts sensu the European Union Regulation on the prevention and management of the introduction and spread of Invasive Alien Species in Europe (IAS Regulation No 1143/2014) (European Union 2014). The purpose of this baseline is to set a representative geographic account of the distribution of these species at (i) country and (ii) 10km2 grid level before the entry into force of the Regulation (and the listing of species through implementing regulations). This distribution provides the baseline for subsequent reporting by the member states as required by the IAS Regulation.

The dataset provides a shapefile on the baseline distribution of the invasive species of EU concern in Belgium based on an aggregated dataset (ias_belgium_t0_xxxx). Data were compiled from various datasets holding invasive species observations such as data from research institutes and research projects (76%), citizen science observatories (23%) and a range of other sources (1%) such as governmental agencies, water managers, invasive species control companies, angling and hunting organizations etc. Data were normalized using a custom mapping of the original data files to Darwin Core (Wieczorek et al. 2012) where possible. Species names were mapped to the GBIF Backbone Taxonomy (GBIF 2016) using the species API (http://www.gbif.org/developer/species). Appropriate selection of records was performed based on predefined cut-off dates (see data range) and record content validation (see validation procedure). Data were then joined with GRID10k layer Belgium based on GRID10k cellcodes (ETRS_1989_LAEA).

File description

The dataset contains two types of data:

Shapefiles (ias_belgium_t0_2016.zip and ias_belgium_t0_2018.zip) providing the presence of the species of EU concern at 10km2 (European Terrestrial Reference System projection - 1989 ETRS_1989_LAEA) level. The attributes table field “ACCEPTED” provides coded information on the distribution validation: correct squares (Y) represent data overlapping between the collated baseline data for Belgium and the EASIN maps. Incorrect data (N) can represent records mapped on wrong 10km2 squares, non-validated records or records that fall outside of the date range applied. New squares (New) represent previously unpublished data that were absent from EASIN. The work was supervised and validated by the Belgian national scientific council on invasive alien species, an official consultative structure coordinating scientific input and data aggregation between Belgian regions and institutions with regards to technical implementation of the Regulation No 1143/2014 on invasive alien species.

A geojson version of the same shapefiles (ias_belgium_t0_2016.geojson and ias_belgium_t0_2018.geojson), in WGS84 projection.

Date range

The baseline distribution reflects the current status and situation of the IAS of Union concern in Belgium. Historical records were not taken into consideration for the baseline. The choice of cut-off date was based on an analysis of the relative contribution of a year in defining the total distribution of the species at 1km2 grid level (calculated as [the sum of unique UTM 1km2 grid squares year-1/total number of unique UTM  1km2 grid squares for that species]) based on the complete dataset. The dataset comprises observations of Union List invasive species between January 2000 (2000-01-01) and February 2016 (2016-01-31) for the species of the first batch (ias_belgium_t0_2016.zip) and between January 2000 (2000-01-01) and August 2017 (2017-08-31) for the species of the first update of the Union List (ias_belgium_t0_2018.zip). They include both casual data as well as established populations and also comprise data from eradicated populations during that period.

Validation procedure

Record validation was performed to exclude dubious records, wrong identifications etc. This was done based on the IdentificationVerificationStatus field (to which validation information from original data were mapped) if available. In general, non-validated data were not considered for ias_belgium_t0_xxxx. Data were validated in the original datasets based on evidence (e.g. pictures), on the observer’s experience, or based on a set of predefined rules (e.g. automated validation based on geographic filtering). Data from research institutes were generally considered validated. A few casual records of EU list species that were clearly planted were discarded manually. When the original dataset did not mention any validation status, records were not considered validated and therefore not taken into account for ias_belgium_t0_xxxx, unless for Chinese mitten crab Eriocheir sinensis, ruddy duck Oxyura jamaicensis, raccoon Procyon lotor, Siberian ground squirrel Tamias sibiricus, sacred ibis Threskiornis aethiopicus, and red-eared slider Trachemys spp. For these species, we assumed all records were correct as they originate from dedicated sampling (E. sinensis) within research projects or represent species that are readily recognizable by people in the field. Likewise, for the second batch species, all records of Egyptian goose Alopochen aegyptiaca, Himalayan balsam Impatiens glandulifera, giant hogweed Heracleum mantegazzianum and muskrat Ondatra zibethicus (mostly derived from public eradication services) were considered validated and taken into account.

A visual check was performed on the resulting distribution maps by representatives of the national IAS scientific council. Data in the distribution maps provided by EASIN but not present in ias_belgium_t0_xxxx were carefully checked and kept/rejected accordingly.

Data providers

The providers of the invasive species data for this exercise (individuals and their respective organizations) are listed in the ""data providers"" section of the dataset metadata. Much of the primary occurrence data that formed the basis for this aggregated dataset will be published as open data on the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) within the framework of the Tracking Invasive Alien Species project (TrIAS, https://osf.io/7dpgr/, 2017-2020).","- biodiversity

NO,"Biodiversity Portal of the Northern Part of West Siberia, Russia","Biodiversity-related studies in the northern part of West Siberia are relatively recent in line with intensive industrial development of the region in recent decades. The region possesses few biological collections within the universities and nature reserves. Still, the Department of Natural Resources pays considerable attention to the sustainable use of natural resources. On the global scale, the success of biodiversity informatics goals largely depends on the local initiatives and progress in data mobilization and sharing. Therefore, organization of regional biodiversity portals is important to promote data mobilization, education and citizen science on local scale.

Previous experience of biodiversity information systems in the region was low. The program on digitization of observations of Red Listed species was launched in 2010 under the support of the Department of Natural Resources of Yugra. The information system for Red Listed species registrations was developed through this project and currently includes about three thousand observations. Another example of digitization in Western Siberia was developed by the biological collection of Yugra State University. Its database is based on the database management system Specify and available online through its web portal (http://bioportal.ugrasu.ru). Some collections of nature reserves have their catalogues in digital form. The need of biodiversity data mobilization is well understood and is discussed at regular workshops on biological collections management held in Khanty-Mansiysk.

Recently, the biologists curating several biological collections in the region started a project on a regional biodiversity portal development (https://nwsbios.org). The portal has three major components:

the database of collections based on Specify software (http://bioportal.ugrasu.ru), the metadata of different sources of biodiversity information in the region, an educational platform for learning biodiversity informatics, using data published via GBIF and DwC standards.

This initiative of biodiversity data mobilization in the region includes the organization of workshops, discussions and newsletters helping to reach potential data holders and coordinate work. Through this work four different organizations from Khanty-Mansi region have registered accounts in GBIF since 2019 and started uploading data to the GBIF portal. At present there are about 25,000 observations mobilized in GBIF from the Khanty-Mansi and Yamalo-Nenets regions.

The integrated massive publishing of data in the portal will provide new opportunities for biodiversity research and sustainable management of nature resources in the northern part of West Siberia.","- West Siberia

NO,BrainBox: A co-editing platform for neuroimaging data.,"A > A0 poster which is designed for fabric print and can be cut and sewed into two Shorts – the BrainBoxers ;D

The poster was presented at the 2017 Annual Meeting of the Organization for Human Brain Mapping (OHBM) in Vancouver, 25–29 June.

Project:

Thanks to many data sharing initiatives, more and more brain imaging data is accessible online. This is great advance, but access to data is just the beginning. The key challenge remains the substantial amount of human curation, visual quality assessment and manual editing required by neuroimaging data. Currently, researchers need to download the data, and curate, edit and analyse it locally and redundantly in each research group. Many labs cannot embark on this time consuming process and have to discard a large proportion of the available data from their analyses, wasting time and funding.

We aim at solving this challenge by proposing a co-editing platform for neuroimaging, similar to Wikipedia or Google Docs: BrainBox. BrainBox facilitates the creation of distributed teams of researchers collaborating in the analysis of open data – promoting a community effort instead of competition.","- neuroscience

NO,"Building a baseline for habitat-forming corals by a multi-source approach, including Web Ecological Knowledge","In the Mediterranean, habitat-forming corals often characterize essential fish habitats. While their distribution is sufficiently known for the western basin, few data are available from the Central-Eastern Mediterranean Sea (CEM). This study fills this gap supplying the largest dataset ever built on the geographical and bathymetric distribution of the most relevant habitat-forming corals (Eunicella cavolini, Eunicella verrucosa, Eunicella singularis, Leptogorgia sarmentosa, Paramuricea clavata, Corallium rubrum and Savalia savaglia) of the CEM. Information collected from different sources such as literature, citizen science, and from the World Wide Web (WWW) was combined. Videos published on the WWW provided additional information on the presence of fishing lines and signs of damage, as well as on the distribution of purple and yellow-purple colonies of Paramuricea clavata. The study highlighted the impressive amount of information that the WWW can offer to scientists, termed here as Web Ecological Knowledge (WEK). The WEK is constantly fuelled by internauts, representing a free, refreshable, long-term exploitable reservoir of information. A quick and easy method to retrieve data from the WWW was illustrated. In addition, the distribution of corals was overlapped to marine protected areas and to the distribution of environmental conditions suitable for coralligenous habitats, fragile biogenic Mediterranean structures hosting complex assemblages in need of strict protection. The collected data allowed identifying priority areas with high species diversity and sites that are impacted by fishing activities. Supplied data can correctly address conservation and restoration policies in the CEM, adding an important contribution to ecosystem-based marine spatial planning.","- Biogeography

NO,Building an Accounting System for Russian Federation Biological Resources: Birds,"Biological diversity (BD), or diversity of all living organisms and levels of their organization, represents one of the most important natural resources of the country. As with other resources, BD assets and issues need documentation and tracking: it is impossible to protect and manage BD resources without such accounting. We recognize the need is critical for a sophisticated system to store, synthesize, use, and share BD data. Accepting and understanding this need is illustrated by the second Global Biodiversity Informatics Conference (GBIC2) in 2018 Digital documentation of the BD state is not properly established in the Russian Federation, and a scientific analysis of the basics of monitoring of natural resources and their management have been missing.

Contstruction of a comprehensive BD database is an obvious step for biologists. This presentation will cover our view of a practical way to develop of scientific principles and to create an adequate system to documentthe monitoring of biological diversity within the Russian Federation. Digitization and documentation of collections has just begun in the Zoological Museum of Lomonosov Moscow State University, starting with birds. Using thisthis model group, plans are to develop scientific approaches to identify the most important parameters, the analysis and monitoring of which can provide effective knowledge about the composition, spatial distribution, temporal dynamics of the composition, and abundance of this animal group within the country. Once developed, such a system and schema of a monitoring of biological resources can be further transferred with necessary adjustments to other groups of living organisms as well as recommended for use in practical purposes (e.g., conservation, augmentation, efficient use) by the relevant state services.

For the first time, we will carry out a comprehensive analysis of the bird data available to Russian scientists from one of the largest Northern Eurasian collections from Lomonosov Moscow State University and Zoological Institute of Russian Academy of Sciences, St.Petersburg, reflecting composition, variation and historical dynamics of the spatial distribution of birds inRussia territories and adjacent regions over more than two centuries. The project will analyze biomaterial collections for genetic studies, existing collections databases and those under development for faunistics, bioacoustics, literature, and field accounts of Russian ornithological resources. We will parameterize taxonomic composition of a model group, including the presence and levels of intraspecific genetic, morphological and ecological diversity; the spatial distribution of species and subspecies; species and subspecies abundance in different parts of the country; the temporal dynamics of composition, abundance and spatial distribution of birds; main biological peculiarities of species traits; key practical, scientific, educational, and conservation uses of specific species; and their roles in the ecosystems.

We will participate in the organization and support of several databases, atlas projects, monitoring schemes, coordination of citizen science programs and long-time works with foreign colleagues in the European Bird Census Council (https://www.ebcc.info) and several international working groups (e.g. https://www.waderstudygroup.org). A special task is a public relations project oriented toward a state administration for improvement of ideas important to the creation of a system of national accounting of biological resources.","- biological diversity

Improved sensors and improved communication systems open the door to the design of new systems based on citizen science to better monitor the air quality. In this paper, we present a system that relies on the already available Copernicus Environment Service, on Air Quality Monitoring reference stations and on a cluster of new low-cost, low-energy sensor nodes that will improve the resolution of air quality maps. The data collected by this system will be stored in a time series database, and it will be available both to city council managers for decision making and to citizens for informative purposes.

NO,Cammini LTER: walking and cycling with citizens across Italian ecosystems,"Italian ecologists, active in Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER-Italy network) and in biodiversity study (LifeWatch-Italy), launched a process of informal science communication, aimed at increasing ecological awareness and literacy, also through Citizen Science activities. Since 2015, they organized “Cammini LTER”, trails connecting a number of LTER-Italy sites, where researchers walked and cycled with citizens, sharing research questions, methodologies and results. The citizens’ engagement through a physical and visible movement of researchers outside their laboratories enhanced the opportunity to familiarize with a wide variety of Italian ecosystems and with the LTER data acquisition procedures. The slow rhythm of walking or cycling offers the possibility to overcome an exclusively rational and cognitive approach, breaking down the barriers between science and society, and bringing emotions and affectivity into the ecological subjects. Cammini LTER generated a process of mutual learning with the public and induced critical considerations among researchers about relevant aspects of science literacy and public engagement.

NO,"Capacity building for Intergovernmental Platform for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES). Final report 2014: Indo- Norwegian pilot project on capacity building in biodiversity informatics for enhanced decision making, improved nature conservation and sustainable development.","This pilot project has been coordinated by The Norwegian Institute of Nature Research (NINA) in close collaboration with the Wildlife Institute of India (WII), the Norwegian Biodiversity Information Centre (NBIC), The Nature History Museum at the University of Oslo (NHM), the Wildlife Conservation Society- India Program (WCS) and the Centre for Wildlife Studies (CWF) in India. The Norwegian Government has funded the project with support from the Indian Government. The project has collaborated with the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) and has implemented several of the capacity building tools, standards and services offered by GBIF. In addition, WII and NHM host the national GBIF- nodes of India and Norway. Furthermore, the project is closely linked to the Indian and international strategies on biodiversity infrastructure development. The project has focused on national user needs, camera trapping techniques, data management, open access and barriers towards open access. Six case studies demonstrate how biodiversity informatics, camera trapping, data mobilization and access policies can contribute to improved decision making. This has led to a better understanding of camera trapping techniques, occupancy modelling, DNA-analysis, species distribution, human-wildlife conflicts, human disturbance effects on wild mammals, habitat recovery, tiger population management needs and investigation of tiger poaching. The project has conducted a minor data repatriation exercise at Norwegian natural history museums. The capacity-building component of this towards international legacy collections is in the description of how to mobilize data through GBIF. WII has developed a national database and a web-portal for mobilizing camera trap data. These developments are important steps towards a national, open biodiversity data management system for camera trap images and their axillary metadata. The project has developed a Best Practice Guide (BPG) for publishing of biodiversity data derived from camera trapping. This BPG will be maintained by GBIF in the future. This capacity-building pilot project has clearly proved relevance in addressing the capacity building needs identified by IPBES. As the project results show, there are many international synergies in capacity-building of biodiversity informatics, camera trapping, data mobilization, data repatriation, data management and data sharing policy improvement. Finalizing the pilot project, the project partners have decided to look for new possibilities for collaboration under the IPBES.","- biodiversity informatics

NO,Cartesian coordinate robot for dispensing fruit fly food,"The fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, is one of the most important model organisms in biological research. Maintaining stocks of fruit flies in the laboratory is labour-intensive. One task which lends itself to automation is the production of the vials of food in which the flies are reared. Fly facilities typically have to generate several thousand vials of fly food each week to sustain their fly stocks. The system described here combines a Cartesian coordinate robot with a peristaltic pump. The design of the robot is based on the Routy CNC Router created by Mark Carew (http://openbuilds.org/builds/routy-cnc-router-v-slot-belt-pinion.101/), and uses belt and pully actuators for the X and Y axes, and a leadscrew actuator for the Z axis. CNC motion and operation of the peristaltic pump are controlled by grbl (https://github.com/gnea/grbl), an open source, embedded, high performance g-code parser. Grbl is written in optimized C and runs directly on an Arduino. A Raspberry Pi is used to generate and stream G-code instructions to Grbl. A touch screen on the Raspberry Pi provides a graphical user interface to the system. The system has capacity to fill two boxes of fly food vials at a time.

NO,CIGESMED for divers: Establishing a citizen science initiative for the mapping and monitoring of coralligenous assemblages in the Mediterranean Sea,"Over the last decade, inventorying and monitoring of marine biodiversity has significantly benefited from the active engagement of volunteers. Although several Citizen Science projects concern tropical reef ecosystems worldwide, none of the existing initiatives has yet specifically focused on their Mediterranean equivalents. Mediterranean coralline reefs, known as ""coralligenous"", are bioherms primarily built by calcifying rhodophytes on hard substrates under dim-light conditions; they are considered hotspots of biodiversity and are extremely popular among divers due to their complex structure, conspicuous biological wealth and high aesthetic value. Nevertheless, data on their distribution, structure and conservation status is lacking for several Mediterranean areas while they are vulnerable to an increasing number of threats.

In the framework of CIGESMED SeasEra (ERAnet) project a specialized Citizen Science project was launched, aiming to engage enthusiast divers in the study and monitoring of Mediterranean coralligenous assemblages through the gathering of basic information regarding their spatial occurrence, assemblage structure and associated pressures or threats. For its active implementation, a data collection protocol and a multilingual website were developed, comprising an educational module and a data submission platform. Georeferenced data reporting focuses on: (a) basic topographic and abiotic features for the preliminary description of each site, and the creation of data series for sites receiving multiple visits; (b) presence and relative abundance of typical conspicuous species, as well as (c) existence of pressures and imminent threats, for the characterization and assessment of coralligenous assemblages. A variety of tools is provided to facilitate end users, while divers have the choice to report additional information and are encouraged to upload their photographs. The long-term goal is the development of an active community of amateur observers providing widespread and ecologically significant data on coralligenous assemblages.","- Coralligenous assemblages

NO,"Citizen (Science) Involvement in Data Digitization and Enrichment of the Insect Collection of the Museu Nacional de História Natural e da Ciência (Lisboa, Portugal)","The entomological collection of the Museu Nacional de História Natural e da Ciência (MUHNAC), Universidade de Lisboa, includes over 70,000 catalogued specimens, mostly from Portugal and some African countries (Lopes et al. 2016). However, many more remain uncatalogued and thus unavailable to the broader scientific community. To achieve our goal of full access, it is necessary to digitize and validate all data associated with these specimens.

Recently, a large private collection, comprised of several thousand specimens compiled by José Passos de Carvalho, was donated to the Museum. These specimens are prepared and labelled, however no catalogue is available. Therefore, the only available information about each specimen is on the respective label(s).

To acquire this information, specimens are being photographed along with their labels (Fig. 1). Since digitization of specimen labels is labor intensive, we decided to use the Zooniverse platform to involve the public in this task. To this end we have developed a project (currently being tested), entitled ""MB07 - The Insects of the Museu Nacional de História Natural e da Ciência"", with a test dataset of 130 specimens of moths from the Sphingidae family (Insecta, Lepidoptera). The objective is to evaluate the potential of involving the public in the tasks of label transcription and taxonomic determination to enrich and speed collection digitization.

We have developed two distinct workflows: i) one in which users are asked to transcribe information from specimen labels, therefore a pure digitization task; and ii) a second workflow in which volunteers are asked to contribute new taxonomic information based on the specimen images. Therefore, the first task should be accessible to the general user while the second is more directed towards taxonomic specialists and not intended for the general public.

Here we present a preliminary analysis of our experience with this platform and of the obtained data.","- specimen data transcription

NO,Citizen Science and Open Data: a model for Invasive Alien Species in Europe,"Invasive Alien Species (IAS) are a growing threat to Europe's biodiversity. The implementation of European Union Regulation on IAS can benefit from the involvement of the public in IAS recording and management through Citizen Science (CS) initiatives. Aiming to tackle issues related with the use of CS projects on IAS topics, a dedicated workshop titled ""Citizen Science and Open Data: a model for Invasive Alien Species in Europe"" was organized by the Joint Research Centre (JRC) and the European Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST Association). Fifty key stakeholders from all Europe, including two Members of the European Parliament, attended the workshop. With a clear focus on IAS, the workshop aimed at addressing the following issues: a) CS and policy, b) citizen engagement, and c) CS data management. Nine short presentations provided input on CS and IAS issues. Participants discussed specific topics in several round tables (""world café"" style) and reported back their conclusions to the audience and full assembly moderated discussions. Overall, the workshop enabled the sharing of ideas, approaches and best practices regarding CS and IAS. Specific opportunities and pitfalls of using CS data in the whole policy cycle for IAS were recognized. Concerning the implementation of the IAS Regulation, CS data could complement official surveillance systems, and contribute to the early warning of the IAS of Union concern after appropriate validation by the Member States' competent authorities. CS projects can additionally increase awareness and empower citizens. Attendees pointed out the importance for further public engagement in CS projects on IAS that demonstrate specific initiatives and approaches and analyze lessons learned from past experiences. In addition, the workshop noted that the data gathered from different CS projects on IAS are fragmented. It highlighted the need for using an open and accessible platform to upload data originating from CS sources or to mirror validated data into a single, easy-to-use web service, in line with the EU Open Science Strategic Priority. The workshop provided ten key recommendations of best practices for CS projects on IAS, addressed to researchers, policy makers and implementing authorities, indicating future research and policy directions and opportunities.","- Invasive alien species

NO,Citizen science and smartphones take roadkill monitoring to the next level,"Road networks, even in industrialized countries, become denser year after year and traffic volumes continue to increase at a steady pace. It is imperative that we monitor the impact of this trend on wildlife, but monitoring roads for flattened fauna is a time consuming effort and roadkill monitoring projects conducted up till now have been relatively small scale both in terms of time and space. This hampers the progress of road ecology analyses at the population level and at larger landscape extents.

We demonstrate that citizen science projects in combination with smartphones and other new technologies allow analysis at this level and extent, and simultaneously offer more complete data for safer transportation and mitigation of roadkill hotspots. Monitoring roadkill with citizen scientists poses certain challenges regarding data quality and people management, but we show that these challenges can be addressed, which allows researchers to benefit from the many other advantages and possible applications of monitoring roadkill with citizen scientists, including raising public awareness on the matter.","- Citizen science

scientific knowledge is criticized as a non-inclusive process, too. The Citizen Science movement tries
to resolve this deficit by involving citizens into research. In this paper, we introduce agency as an
analytical category into the discussion, focussing on how participants are represented in Citizen Science.
We highlight the interdependencies between the degree of agency granted to the participants in
Citizen Science projects and the degree of their representation in knowledge production.","- Citizen Science

NO,"Citizen Science as an act of innovation: librarians, scientists and citizens claiming new knowledge structures","In its recommendations, the Open Science Policy Platform identified Citizen Science as one of the key streams to strengthen the dialogue between science and society. Citizen Science projects produce interesting results but, more than that, they challenge the shape of current scholarly processes. The OSPP has emphatically linked libraries with Citizen Science, as being “well placed” for a number of activities. The role they can have has been echoed in Open Science Roadmaps from LIBER and LERU. The potential that OSPP sees in libraries is a responsibility that libraries have to respond to. In this frame, the presentation will introduce the new working group of LIBER that is expected to start working after June 2019 and will give an outline of the key areas that research libraries will need to work. These areas will help us prepare a future where sustainable new structures of knowledge will help European citizens participate in scientific processes.","- Open science

NO,Citizen science at the borders of Romance (www.doedat.be),"Many, if not most, countries have several official or widely used languages. And most, if not all, of these countries have herbaria. Furthermore, specimens have been exchanged between herbaria from many countries, so herbaria are often polylingual collections. It is therefore useful to have label transcription systems that can attract users proficient in a wide variety of languages. Belgium is a typical polylingual country at the boundary between the Romance and Franconian languages (French, Dutch & German). Yet, currently there are few non-English transcription platforms for citizen science. This is why in Belgium we built DoeDat, from the Digivol system of the Atlas of Living Australia.

We will be demonstrating DoeDat and its multilingual features. We will explain how we enter translations, both for the user interface and for the dynamic parts of the website. We will share our experiences of running a multilingual site and the challenges it brings. Translating and running such a website requires skilled personnel and patience. However, our experience has been positive and the number and quality of our volunteer transcriptions has been rewarding. We look forward to the further use of DoeDat to transcribe data in many other languages. There are no reasons anymore to exclude willing volunteers in any language.",,publication,Journal article,article,2018-05-21,,1254655,10.3897/biss.2.24991,1254656,"- Groom, Quentin

NO,Citizen Science Network Austria – Leistungsbericht 2017,"Dies ist der erste Leistungsbericht des Citizen Science Networks Austria und der Plattform Österreich forscht. Mit diesem Bericht möchten wir einen weiteren Schritt in Richtung Transparenz gehen und somit den Dialog zwischen Wissenschaft und Gesellschaft in Österreich fördern.

Mit der Gründung im März 2014 als erstes Netzwerk für Citizen Science Projekte in Österreich und vermutlich auch Europas, wurde eine auch international beachtete Erfolgsgeschichte gestartet. Zahlreiche weitere nationale und internationale Citizen Science Plattformen, die nach Österreich forscht gegründet wurden, wie z.B. Bürger schaffen Wissen, Schweiz forscht oder auch das Zentrum für Citizen Science angesiedelt im OeAD, haben ebenfalls das Potential von Citizen Science erkannt. Einladungen zu internationalen Konferenzen als Best practice-Beispiel, das enorme Wachstum von Österreich forscht seit der Gründung und nicht zuletzt auch das steigende Interesse an der Österreichischen Citizen Science Konferenz,  der einzigen deutschsprachigen Citizen Science Konferenz, belegen diesen Erfolg. Und Citizen Science ist kein Randphänomen, wie derzeit noch oft behauptet wird. Allein drei Studien, die dieses Jahr mit teilweise erschreckenden Zahlen den Rückgang der Biodiversität gezeigt haben, beruhen auf Citizen Science Daten, und die mehr als 100.000 Teilnehmerinnen und Teilnehmer, die bei allen auf Österreich forscht präsentierten Projekten mitmachen, zeigen dies eindrucksvoll.

Mit den in Kürze veröffentlichten Qualitätskriterien gehen das Citizen Science Network Austria und Österreich forscht auch 2018 wieder international beachtet voran. Im Sinne der Transparenz und Verantwortung, welche Citizen Science mit sich bringt, wird Österreich forscht die erste Plattform sein, die sich strengen Qualitätsvorschriften unterwirft, damit sich Teilnehmerinnen und Teilnehmer von auf Österreich forscht präsentierten Projekten sicher sein können, das verantwortungsvolle Forschung durch ihr ehrenamtliches Engagement möglich wird.","- citizen science

NO,Citizen Science Pilot Experiment in High Schools,"The paper contains three parts. The first part presents the theoretical backgrounds of the relationship between science and civil society, and the concept as well as concrete examples of the Citizen Science. The second part reports the results of a pilot study (sondage) in which  students from five (Slovenian) High Schools expressed their views regarding the meaning of ecology and sustainable development. In the third part, so-called group-feedback analysis with the participation of students is considered, regarded as a contribution to the concept of the Citizen Science Experiment. The results show that while the students are receiving solid knowledge on ecological and environmental issues, especially in biology courses, there is a certain lack of more integral didactic approaches and the students’ interests seem to be more declarative and pragmatic (school-centric).","- citizen science, high schools, ecology, sustainable development, civil society, environmental studies, biology, sociology",publication,Journal article,article,2018-07-03,10.5281/zenodo.1304052,1304052,10.5281/zenodo.1304053,1304053,- Frane Adam,eng
NO,Citizen science shows systematic changes in the temperature difference between air and inland waters with global warming,"In this study, we conducted a citizen science project that involved more than 3500 Swedish high school students to examine the temperature difference between surface water and the overlying air (Tw-Ta) as a proxy for sensible heat flux (QH). If QH is directed upward, corresponding to positive Tw-Ta, it can enhance CO2 and CH4 emissions from inland waters, thereby contributing to increased greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere. The students found mostly negative Tw-Ta across small ponds, lakes, streams/rivers and the sea shore (i.e. downward QH), with Tw-Ta becoming increasingly negative with increasing Ta. Further examination of Tw-Ta using high-frequency temperature data from inland waters across the globe confirmed that Tw-Ta is linearly related to Ta. Using the longest available high-frequency temperature time series from Lake Erken, Sweden, we found a rapid increase in the occasions of negative Tw-Ta with increasing annual mean Ta since 1989. From these results, we can expect that ongoing and projected global warming will result in increasingly negative Tw-Ta, thereby reducing CO2 and CH4 transfer velocities from inland waters into the atmosphere",,publication,Journal article,article,2017-03-06,,818629,10.1038/srep43890,818630,"- Weyhenmeyer, Gesa A.

NO,Citizen Science: The First Peninsular Malaysia Butterfly Count,"Over the past 50 years, Southeast Asia has suffered the greatest losses of biodiversity of any tropical region in the world. Malaysia is a biodiversity hotspot in the heart of Southeast Asia with roughly the same number of mammal species, three times the number of butterfly species, but only 4% of the land area of Australia. Consequently, in Malaysia, there is an urgent need for biodiversity monitoring and also public engagement with wildlife to raise awareness of biodiversity loss. Citizen science is ""on the rise"" globally and can make valuable contributions to long-term biodiversity monitoring, but perhaps more importantly, involving the general public in science projects can raise public awareness and promote engagement. Butterflies are often the focus of citizen science projects due to their charisma and familiarity and are particularly valuable ""ambassadors"" of biodiversity conservation for public outreach.

Here we present the data from our citizen science project, the first ""Peninsular Malaysia Butterfly Count"". Participants were asked to go outdoors on June 6, 2015, and (non-lethally) sample butterfly legs for species identification through DNA barcoding. Fifty-seven citizens responded to our adverts and registered to take part in the butterfly count with many registering on behalf of groups. Collectively the participants sampled 220 butterfly legs from 26 mostly urban and suburban sampling localities. These included our university campus, a highschool, several public parks and private residences. On the basis of 192 usable DNA barcodes, 43 species were sampled by the participants. The most sampled species was Appias olferna, followed by Junonia orithya and Zizina otis. Twenty-two species were only sampled once, five were only sampled twice, and four were only sampled three times. Three DNA barcodes could not be assigned species names. The sampled butterflies revealed that widely distributed, cosmopolitan species, often those recently arrived to the peninsula or with documented ""invasive"" potential, dominated the habitat types sampled by the participants. Data from this first Butterfly Count helps establish a baseline from which we can monitor the patterns and changes in butterfly communities in Peninsular Malaysia.","- DNA barcoding

Abstract:

Large-scale observational data from citizen science efforts are becoming increasingly common in ecology, and researchers often choose between these and data from intensive local-scale studies for their analyses. This choice has potential trade-offs related to spatial scale, observer variance, and inter-annual variability. Here we explored this issue with phenology by comparing models built using data from the large-scale, citizen science National Phenology Network (NPN) effort with models built using data from more intensive studies at Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) sites. We built process based phenology models for species common to each dataset. From these models we compared parameter estimates, estimates of phenological events, and out-of-sample errors between models derived from both NPN and LTER data. We found that model parameter estimates for the same species were most similar between the two datasets when using simple models, but parameter estimates varied widely as model complexity increased. Despite this, estimates for the date of phenological events and out-of-sample errors were similar, regardless of the model chosen. Predictions for NPN data had the lowest error when using models built from the NPN data, while LTER predictions were best made using LTER-derived models, confirming that models perform best when applied at the same scale they were built. Accordingly, the choice of dataset depends on the research question. Inferences about species-specific phenological requirements are best made with LTER data, and if NPN or similar data are all that is available, then analyses should be limited to simple models. Large-scale predictive modeling is best done with the larger-scale NPN data, which has high spatial representation and a large regional species pool. LTER datasets, on the other hand, have high site fidelity and thus characterize inter-annual variability extremely well. Future research aimed at forecasting phenology events for particular species over larger scales should develop models which integrate the strengths of both datasets.

NO,Complexity beyond pure reason? Emergence through the lens of coincidence,"In this talk I will introduce Transcendental Information Cascades, a method to understand the temporal dynamics of naturally occurring complex systems. The distinctive feature of the approach is that it relies on a specific kind of spatio-temporal network that represents information token recurrence and coincidence. Transcendental Information Cascades make formerly hidden dimensions of sequential data accessible and throw up novel questions about chaos and randomness. I will present various applications of the method in different domains such as the analysis of digital traces in online communities, English literature, and micro-linguistics.

NO,Connecting data and expertise: a new alliance for biodiversity knowledge,"There has been major progress over the last two decades in digitising historical knowledge of biodiversity and in making biodiversity data freely and openly accessible. Interlocking efforts bring together international partnerships and networks, national, regional and institutional projects and investments and countless individual contributors, spanning diverse biological and environmental research domains, government agencies and non-governmental organisations, citizen science and commercial enterprise. However, current efforts remain inefficient and inadequate to address the global need for accurate data on the world's species and on changing patterns and trends in biodiversity. Significant challenges include imbalances in regional engagement in biodiversity informatics activity, uneven progress in data mobilisation and sharing, the lack of stable persistent identifiers for data records, redundant and incompatible processes for cleaning and interpreting data and the absence of functional mechanisms for knowledgeable experts to curate and improve data.

Recognising the need for greater alignment between efforts at all scales, the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) convened the second Global Biodiversity Informatics Conference (GBIC2) in July 2018 to propose a coordination mechanism for developing shared roadmaps for biodiversity informatics. GBIC2 attendees reached consensus on the need for a global alliance for biodiversity knowledge, learning from examples such as the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) and the open software communities under the Apache Software Foundation. These initiatives provide models for multiple stakeholders with decentralised funding and independent governance to combine resources and develop sustainable solutions that address common needs.

This paper summarises the GBIC2 discussions and presents a set of 23 complementary ambitions to be addressed by the global community in the context of the proposed alliance. The authors call on all who are responsible for describing and monitoring natural systems, all who depend on biodiversity data for research, policy or sustainable environmental management and all who are involved in developing biodiversity informatics solutions to register interest at https://biodiversityinformatics.org/ and to participate in the next steps to establishing a collaborative alliance.

The supplementary materials include brochures in a number of languages (English, Arabic, Spanish, Basque, French, Japanese, Dutch, Portuguese, Russian, Traditional Chinese and Simplified Chinese). These summarise the need for an alliance for biodiversity knowledge and call for collaboration in its establishment.","- Biodiversity

NO,Considerable Progress in Russian GBIF Community,"Russia is a huge gap on the open access global biodiversity map of the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). National biodiversity data are stored in various sources including museums, herbaria, scientific literature and reports as well as in the private collections and local databases. The best known and largest of the Russian herbarium collections are the collections stored in Komarov Botanical Institute of the Russian Academy of Science (>6 M sheets) and Moscow University (>1 M sheets). The largest zoological collection is located in Zoological institute of the Russian Academy of Science, with >60 M specimens. But most of the national biodiversity data is not yet digitized. The national biodiversity portal as well as the list of Russian biodiversity data sources are still absent. Despite this, projects and other activities are implemented to mobilize a national data using international biodiversity data standards.

Currently Russia is not a GBIF member, but in the last 5 years, more than 1.6 M occurrences were published by Russian publishers through GBIF.org (69 datasets at the end of March 2019). The largest GBIF data provider in Russia is the Lomonosov Moscow State University. The Digital Moscow University Herbarium includes 971,732 specimens collected from Russia and many other countries. The Russian GBIF community is steadily expanding (Fig. 1); this is reflected in an increase in the number of publishers and published datasets. The current GBIF network infrastructure in Russia includes 5 IPT (Integrated Publishing Toolkit) installations in Saint Petersburg (two), Pushchino (Moscow region), Moscow, and Syktyvkar (Komi Republic).

Russian-language biodiversity informatics materials are collected and presented from an informal web site http://gbif.ru/ with three main sections:

data publishing through GBIF, Russian GBIF activities, and Russian biodiversity data sources.

Additional sections are dedicated to iNaturalist citizen science system and Russian Specify Software Project community. We provide technical helpdesk support not only for Russian publishers, but also for Russian speakers from the former USSR. The national mailing-list (via google groups) aims to provide a platform for news sharing. Now it includes >240 subscribers.

Since the end of 2014, regular biodiversity informatics events are being held in Russia. Last year, two data training courses, funded by GBIF (project ID Russia-02 - ""GBIF.ru data mobilization activities"") and ForBIO (Research school in biosystematics), were organized in Moscow and Irkutsk region with the participation of 29 Russian researchers. National biodiversity informatics conferences were held in Apatity (2017) and Irkutsk (2018).

We believe Russia already has a well established community that can become the basis for further development when Russia becomes a GBIF member.","- Russia

NO,COSA: Cloud Object Storage Archive for deep archival of digital data,"The Cornell Lab of Ornithology gathers, utilizes and archives a wide variety of digital assets ranging from details of a bird observation to photos, video and sound recordings. Some of these datasets are fairly small, while others are hundreds of terabytes. In this presentation we will describe how the Lab archives these datasets to ensure the data are both loss-less and recoverable in the case of a widespread disaster, how the archival strategy has evolved over the years and explore in detail the current hybrid cloud storage management system.

The Lab runs eBird and several other citizen science programs focused on birds where individuals from around the globe enter their sightings into a centralized database. The eBird project alone stores over 500,000,000 observations and the underlying database is over a terabyte in size. Birds of North America, Neotropical Birds and All About Birds are online species accounts comprising a wide range of authoritative live history articles maintained in a relatively small database. Macaulay Library is the world's largest image, sound and video archive with over 6,000,000 cuts totaling nearly 100 TB of data. The Bioacoustics Research Program utilizes automated recording units (SWIFTs) in the forests of the US, jungles of Africa and in all seven oceans to record the environment. These units record 24 hours a day and gather a tremendous about of raw data, over 200 TB to date with an expected rate of an additional 100TB per year. Lastly, BirdCams run by the lab add a steady stream of media detailing the reproductive cycles of a number of species. The lab is committed to making these archives of the natural world available for research and conservation today. More importantly, ensuring these data exist and are accessible in 100 years is a critical component of the Lab data strategy.

The data management system for these digital assets has been completely overhauled to handle the rapidly increasing volume and to utilize on-premises systems and cloud services in a hybrid cloud storage system to ensure data are archived in a manner that is redundant, loss-less and insulated from disasters yet still accessible for research. With multimedia being the largest and most rapidly growing block of data, cost rapidly becomes a constraining factor of archiving these data in redundant, geographically isolated facilities. Datasets with a smaller footprint, eBIrd and species accounts allow for a wider variety of solutions as cost is less of a factor. Using different methods to take advantage of differing technologies and balancing cost vs recovery speed, the Lab has implemented several strategies based on data stability (eBird data are constantly changing), retrieval frequency required for research and overall size of the dataset. We utilize Amazon S3 and Glacier as our media archive, we tag each media in Glacier with a set of basic DarwinCore metatdata fields that key back to a master metadata database and numerous project specific databases. Because these metadata databases are much smaller in size, yet critical in searching and retrieval of a required media file, they are archived differently with up to the minute replication to prevent any data loss due to an unexpected disaster. The media files are tagged with a standard set of basic metadata and in the case where the metadata databases were unavailable, retrieval of specific media and basic metadata can still occur.

This system has allowed the lab to place into long term archive hundreds of terabytes of data, store them in redundant, geographically isolated locations and provide for complete disaster recovery of the data and metadata.",- cloud object store deep archive cornell multimedia,publication,Journal article,article,2018-05-22,,1255432,10.3897/biss.2.25811,1255433,"- Gerbracht, Jeff",
NO,COSplay: Contrast Optimized Stimulation Player,"In many research areas, the functioning of complex systems is probed by measuring stimulus-evoked responses. Commonly, stimulus train delivery is coordinated by in-house and/or proprietary solutions, which are often ill-documented, expensive, poorly reproducible, high-maintenance, and unsustainable. Here we present a fully Free and Open Source (FOSS) and hackable framework consisting of a Micro/Python package and a simple compatible circuit schema; which can be used to build and operate a stimulus train delivery device with up to microsecond accuracy. This project includes a complete, step-by-step video tutorial to demonstrate the assembly of the COSplayer [@cosplayer], a free and open source hardware device which serves as the reference implementation for the technology.","- fMRI

NO,Crowdsourcing the identification of organisms: A case-study of iSpot,"Accurate species identification is fundamental to biodiversity science, but the natural history skills required for this are neglected in formal education at all levels. In this paper we describe how the web application ispotnature.org and its sister site ispot.org.za (collectively, ""iSpot"") are helping to solve this problem by combining learning technology with crowdsourcing to connect beginners with experts. Over 94% of observations submitted to iSpot receive a determination. External checking of a sample of 3,287 iSpot records verified > 92% of them. To mid 2014, iSpot crowdsourced the identification of 30,000 taxa (>80% at species level) in > 390,000 observations with a global community numbering > 42,000 registered participants. More than half the observations on ispotnature.org were named within an hour of submission. iSpot uses a unique, 9-dimensional reputation system to motivate and reward participants and to verify determinations. Taxon-specific reputation points are earned when a participant proposes an identification that achieves agreement from other participants, weighted by the agreers' own reputation scores for the taxon. This system is able to discriminate effectively between competing determinations when two or more are proposed for the same observation. In 57% of such cases the reputation system improved the accuracy of the determination, while in the remainder it either improved precision (e.g. by adding a species name to a genus) or revealed false precision, for example where a determination to species level was not supported by the available evidence. We propose that the success of iSpot arises from the structure of its social network that efficiently connects beginners and experts, overcoming the social as well as geographic barriers that normally separate the two.","- Biodiversity

NO,"Crowdsourcing, is it a good option for your collection digitization?","Globally there are a number of citizen science portals to support digitisation of biodiversity collections. Digitisation not only involves imaging of the specimen itself, but also includes the digital transcription of label and ledger data, georeferencing and linking to other digital resources. Making use of the skills and enthusiasm of volunteers is potentially a good way to reduce the great backlog of specimens to be digitised.

These citizen science portals engage the public and are liberating data that would otherwise remain on paper. There is also considerable scope for expansion into other countries and languages. Therefore, should we continue to expand? Volunteers give their time for free, but the creation and maintenance of the platform is not without costs. Given a finite budget, what can you get for your money? How does the quality compare with other methods? Is crowdsourcing of label transcription faster, better and cheaper than other forms of transcription system?

We will summarize the use of volunteer transcription from our own experience and the reports of other projects. We will make our evaluation based on the costs, speed and quality of the systems and reach conclusions on why you should or should not use this method.",,publication,Journal article,article,2018-05-21,,1254665,10.3897/biss.2.25410,1254666,"- Groom, Quentin

NO,D4.1 Report on performance criteria for field testing. Deliverable report of project H2020 MONOCLE (grant 776480),"This document constitutes Deliverable 4.1 of the MONOCLE project and provides an overview of the key performance indicators (KPIs) for each sensor or system as defined at the start of the project, briefly summarised as follows.

Prosumer units of a Remote Piloted Aircraft System (RPAS), either DJI Phantom 4 pro or DJI M200,  equipped with a range of cameras (RBG, Micasense Red-edge or Multispectral) are intended to be deployed by professionals and citizen science groups. These sensors measure radiance of the water surface and convert this to water-leaving reflectance, which will be validated by a TriOS Ramses, ASD Field Spec or WISP system. Concentrations of total suspended matter (TSM) and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) derived from the camera imagery will be validated against laboratory measurements. Target measurement precision and performance accuracy for all parameters will be tested and are expected to depend on illumination conditions.

The HSP1 is a fixed installation that will collect global and diffuse irradiance measurements, to be validated against a sun photometer (e.g. Cimel) in the field. Measurement precision is in the range of 3-5%, while target performance accuracy is 5% uncertainty/offset.

The CLAM is presently a bench top flow-through system which measures in situ Chl-a concentrations.  Measurements will be validated against accredited laboratory analysis of Chl-a (e.g. High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC)).  Measurement range and precision are to be tested and feed back into the development cycle, while target performance accuracy will be 10% uncertainty/offset.

The sun tracking radiometer platform is a ship-mounted device for control of the azimuth viewing angle of radiometers with respect to the sun and ship heading.  Reference values can be calculated from ship compass and solar position. Measurement precision is 1°, while target performance accuracy is <1% uncertainty assuming the viewing angle is consistently >90° and a ship heading is available.

The iSPEX is a smartphone add-on for citizen science measurements of aerosol optical thickness (AOT), which will be adapted for MONOCLE to measure water colour.  Measurements of AOT will be validated against groundSPEX, MODIS or AERONET measurements.  AOT measurement precision is >5% per individual measurement and <1% when stacking >50 measurements, and target performance accuracy is <10% uncertainty/offset. 

The KdUINO is a profiling device from a surface buoy that measures the light extinction coefficient (Kd).  It will be adapted for MONOCLE with a new sensor and hardware, improved accuracy and temperature sensors.  Measurements will be validated in the laboratory against TriOS radiometers, and precision and accuracy will be defined during the MONOCLE campaigns to feed back into the development cycle.

 

The WISPStation is a fixed installation which measures remote sensing reflectance (Rrs(l)). Measurements will be validated against other high-end calibrated field spectroradiometers (e.g. TriOS Ramses). Measurement precision is 2%, depending on the ambient light and wave conditions) and target performance accuracy will be determined during the MONOCLE campaigns.

FreshWater Watch is an established citizen science method for monitoring of global freshwaters, which includes assessments of water colour, turbidity (Secchi tubes) and colourimetric phosphate measurement using inosine enzymatic reactions.  Phosphate measurements will be validated in the laboratory (Skalar SAN++ system autoanalyzer with ammonium molybdate). Measurement precision is 43% (Relative Standard Deviation - to be confirmed) and performance accuracy will be defined during the MONOCLE campaigns.

The system KPIs described in this deliverable will inform planning of the forthcoming MONOCLE field campaigns as well as the novel development activities (WP2 & WP3) and innovation activities (WP5, WP6 & WP7).",,publication,Project deliverable,deliverable,2018-11-20,10.5281/zenodo.1492177,1492177,10.5281/zenodo.1492178,1492178,"- Riddick, Caitlin

NO,D4.2 Report compiling test and validation site characteristics. Deliverable report of project H2020 MONOCLE (grant 776480),"Several validation sites were selected for MONOCLE to ensure they represent a broad range of biogeochemical properties and deployment conditions in which to validate innovative in situ sensors, platforms and methods. The validation sites include the inland waters Loch Leven (Scotland), Lake Balaton (Hungary), Lake Dunkern (Sweden) and Lake Tanganyika (Tanzania), as well as the Razelm-Sinoe coastal lagoon system (Romania). The MONOCLE project also has access to test sites, which are sites frequently used by MONOCLE partners for specific instrument development.  Whilst no collective campaigns are planned around test sites, access to these sites provides an additional opportunity for testing by the MONOCLE consortium and can be organised locally.

All validation sites are subject to anthropogenic impacts, and many are of great economic value to the local areas. These water bodies also represent areas of the weakest performance in present Earth Observation (EO) capabilities for retrieval of water quality parameters. Some sites have been well characterised in terms of bio-geo-optical properties, in previous projects (e.g. Loch Leven and Lake Balaton), while others are in relatively data-poor regions with regard to optical properties (e.g. Lake Dunkern, Lake Tanganyika and the Razelm-Sinoe Lagoon).  The validation sites cover a range of climates and geographic locations, as well as a range of trophic status (oligotrophic to eutrophic) and optical water types, as shown through processed EO data.

There are varying deployment opportunities at each site (e.g. boats, buoys, ferries, citizen science opportunities) to allow for sufficient validation approaches and capabilities for the MONOCLE systems.  Also highlighted in this deliverable are the laboratory facilities available (or not) and the typical sampling locations for historic data at each site, which will aid implementation of each field campaign.

Ultimately, these five validation sites sufficiently cover a range of bio-geo-optical properties to provide robust validation campaigns for the MONOCLE sensors and systems. The site characteristics presented here will be supplemented with high-end bio-optical characterisation of each field site during the MONOCLE campaigns, including any seasonal and spatial variations. ",,publication,Project deliverable,deliverable,2018-11-20,10.5281/zenodo.1492252,1492252,10.5281/zenodo.1492253,1492253,"- Riddick, Caitlin

NO,"D7.1 Report on existing EO services, existing in situ data resources and protocols. Deliverable report of project H2020 MONOCLE (grant 776480)","This report summarizes existing EO services, validation resources, best practices/protocols and the methods employed to integrate multiple sources of in situ reference data with EO data processing. A wide variety of in situ data sampling techniques are currently available from fixed platforms (e.g. AERONET-OC or CEFAS buoys) or moving platforms (e.g. boats, ships and increasingly remotely operated aircraft), collected in various databases. Despite these efforts, many waterbodies and most inland waters remain under-sampled hampering comprehensive validation of satellite remote sensing of water quality variables. Lowering the cost of sensors, deployment methods and including citizen science have a high potential to fill these observation gaps.

To integrate existing and new in situ data into EO services, they have to be accessible in a clearly structured way. A pre-defined data format with metadata, containing information on source, location, calibration and applied algorithms, allows easy interpretation and traceability of the data. Quality control checks and flagging suboptimal observations are required to ensure their correct use. ",,publication,Project deliverable,deliverable,2018-11-20,10.5281/zenodo.1492282,1492282,10.5281/zenodo.1492283,1492283,"- De Keukelaere, Liesbeth

NO,Data Location Quality at GBIF,"I will cover how the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) handles data quality issues, with specific focus on coordinate location issues, such as gridded datasets (Fig. 1) and country centroids. I will highlight the challenges GBIF faces identifying potential data quality problems and what we and others (Zizka et al. 2019) are doing to discover and address them.

GBIF is the largest open-data portal of biodiversity data, which is a large network of individual datasets (> 40k) from various sources and publishers. Since these datasets are variable both within themselves and dataset-to-dataset, this creates a challenge for users wanting to use data collected from museums, smartphones, atlases, satellite tracking, DNA sequencing, and various other sources for research or analysis.

Data quality at GBIF will always be a moving target (Chapman 2005), and GBIF already handles many obvious errors such as zero/impossible coordinates, empty or invalid data fields, and fuzzy taxon matching. Since GBIF primarily (but not exclusively) serves lat-lon location information, there is an expectation that occurrences fall somewhat close to where the species actually occurs. This is not always the case. Occurrence data can be hundereds of kilometers away from where the species naturally occur, and there can be multiple reasons for why this can happen, which might not be entirely obvious to users.

One reasons is that many GBIF datasets are gridded. Gridded datasets are datasets that have low resolution due to equally-spaced sampling. This can be a data quality issue because a user might assume an occurrence record was recorded exactly at its coordinates. Country centroids are another reason why a species occurrence record might be far from where it occurs naturally. GBIF does not yet flag country centroids, which are records where the dataset publishers has entered the lat-long center of a country instead of leaving the field blank. I will discuss the challenges surrounding locating these issues and the current solutions (such as the CoordinateCleaner R package).

I will touch on how existing DWCA terms like coordinateUncertaintyInMeters and footprintWKT are being utilized to highlight low coordinate resolution. Finally, I will highlight some other emerging data quality issues and how GBIF is beginning to experiment with dataset-level flagging. Currently we have flagged around 500 datasets as gridded and around 400 datasets as citizen science, but there are many more potential dataset flags.","- GBIF

The Heracleum sosnowsky plants has low freezing tolerance and die in temperature range minus 6–12 °С. Snow cover provides stable soil temperature (not lower than  minus 3 °С) and is the only factor that ensures the survival of H. sosnowsky plants in the regions with cold winter. The H. sosnowsky frost tolerance is higher in autumn (up to minus 12 °С) and became lower at spring (minus 5–7 °С). These results can be explained by absence of deep dormancy in H. sosnowskyi meristem tissues and gradual change of carbohydrate content in them during the cold period. The seeds have high freezing tolerance after its formation but lost it after stratification. The field experiments were carried out by participants of citizen science project “Moroz”. It was shown that H. sosnowskyi plant eradication probability with the help of snow removal completely depends on weather conditions. This method can be used only on the territories where the use of herbicides is prohibited and only in the regions with minimal temperature in January – Febrary not higher than minus 25 °С. The dataset with all measurements made during the experiments is available on the site of “Moroz” project (http://proborshevik.ru).","- Heracleum sosnowskyi, invasion management, frost resistance, winter hardiness, citizen science",dataset,Dataset,,2019-07-10,10.5281/zenodo.3300551,3300551,10.5281/zenodo.3300552,3300552,"- Dalke Igor

NO,Dead wood fungi in North America: an insight into research and conservation potential,"Saproxylic fungi act as keystone species in forest ecosystems because they colonise and decompose dead wood, facilitating colonisation by later species. Here, we review the importance of intact forest ecosystems to dead wood fungi, as well as trends in their diversity research and challenges in conservation. Saproxylic communities are sensitive to transition from virgin forests to managed ecosystems, since the latter often results in reduced tree diversity and the removal of their natural habitat dead wood. The impact of dead wood management can be quite significant since many saproxylic fungi are host-specific. The significance of citizen science and educational programmes for saproxylic mycology is discussed with the emphasis on the North American region. We intend to raise the awareness of the role that dead wood fungi play in forest health in order to support development of corresponding conservational programmes.","- saproxylic fungi

NO,Deliverable 7.4 (D7.4) Strategies and business plan for regional and global  biodiversity information infrastructures,"uploaded for EU BON by Plazi

The EU BON project aims to Build the European Biodiversity Observation Network, and is the European contribution to the Group on Earth Observation Biodiversity Observation Network (GEO BON). This present deliverable, entitled “Strategies and business plan for regional and global biodiversity information infrastructures” (D7.4) fits under EU BON Work Package (WP) 7 “Implementation of GEO BON: strategies and solutions at European and global levels”, and provides an overview of the outputs resulting from two WP7 Tasks. The objectives of this deliverable were to develop (1) a strategy for a global GEO BON infrastructure with optimised functionality in terms of efficiency and operability (as part of Task 7.4), and (2) a business plan for sustaining the European Biodiversity Observation Network after the funded phase (as part of Task 7.5).

Building on the outputs from other EU BON work packages and extensive consultation (including externally to the project consortium), these objectives have been met. The global and European-level map of the biodiversity informatics landscape (Task 7.4) has led to a better understanding of the landscape’s current structure and functioning. This will enable key players to establish or strengthen collaborations, avoid effort duplication, and facilitate access to the biodiversity data, information and knowledge required to support effective decision-making. The business plan for the European Biodiversity Observation Network (Task 7.5) summarises what the network has to offer, to identified end-users (from policy, science/research, and citizen-science), in terms of products, tools and services, including those that can potentially generate income. A possible organisational structure, potential sources of funding, along with entry points for the network in other projects and initiatives (established or upcoming), are also presented.

As this forestry crop grows in popularity around the world, the exotic introduction of pests such as the leaf beetles belonging to the genera Paropsis Oliver, 1807 and Paropsisterna Motschulsky, 1860 increases in frequency. These pest introductions have spurred a need to understand the natural enemies of these pests for use in classical biological control programs. One such enemy, Eadya paropsidis Huddleston & Short, 1978 (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), has shown potential as a biological control agent against Paropsis charybdis, an exotic pest of New Zealand Eucalyptus plantations. However, observations made by biocontrol researchers have raised concerns that E. paropsidis is a complex of cryptic species. A comprehensive large-scale phylogenetic study utilizing both host and molecular data (Peixoto et al. 2018), as well as a morphological multivariate ratio analysis, was utilized to ensure accurate delimitation of the species of Eadya. Here we formally describe the three new species (Eadya annleckieae Ridenbaugh, 2018, sp. n., Eadya daenerys Ridenbaugh, 2018, sp. n., Eadya spitzer Ridenbaugh, 2018, sp. n.), and one additional new species discovered in the Australian National Insect Collection (Eadya duncan Ridenbaugh, 2018, sp. n.). All distributions and host associations for Eadya are listed as well as a redescription of the originally described E. paropsidis and E. falcata. An illustrated key to all known species is included to assist biological control researchers. The value of citizen science observations is discussed, along with the need for a further understanding of mainland Eadya populations given the recent spread of paropsine pests. Finally, we discuss the subfamilial placement of Eadya, and suggest it belongs within Euphorinae based on morphological characters.","- Animalia

NO,Design Criteria for Achieving Acceptable Indoor Radon Concentration,"Design criteria for achieving an acceptable indoor radon concentration are presented in this paper. The paper suggests three design criteria. These criteria have to be considered at the early stage of the building design phase to meet the latest recommendations from the World Health Organization in most countries. The three design criteria are; first, establishing a radon barrier facing the ground; second, lowering the air pressure in the lower zone of the slab on ground facing downwards; third, diluting the indoor air with outdoor air. The first two criteria can prevent radon from infiltrating from the ground, and the third criteria can dilute the indoor air. By combining these three criteria, the indoor radon concentration can be lowered achieving an acceptable level. In addition, a cheap and reliable method for measuring the radon concentration in the indoor air is described. The provision on radon in the Danish Building Regulations complies with the latest recommendations from the World Health Organization. Radon can cause lung cancer and it is not known whether there is a lower limit for when it is not harmful to human beings. Therefore, it is important to reduce the radon concentration as much as possible in buildings. Airtightness is an important factor when dealing with buildings. It is important to avoid air leakages in the building envelope both facing the atmosphere, e.g. in compliance with energy requirements, but also facing the ground, to meet the requirements to ensure and control the indoor environment. Infiltration of air from the ground underneath a building is the main providing source of radon to the indoor air.","- Radon

NO,Design for (every)one: Co-creation as a bridge between universal design and rehabilitation engineering.,"In this paper the authors describe a general framework for co-designing assistive devices in a horizontal user innovation network [1] by and for disabled users. This framework attempts to identify, share and use “hidden solutions” in rehabilitation contexts and translate them into disruptive assistive devices build with local resources. Within healthcare contexts local solutions are frequently more effective, as they reflect the physical, emotional and cognitive needs of specific patients and engage all the stakeholders in a specific local context. By using an open horizontal innovation network, where assistive devices can be easily shared and physically hacked by other paramedics, general patterns can be detected and translated into standard universal design objects. This generative design thinking approach [2] is more than feasible with digital trends like crowd sourcing, user-generated content and peer production [3]. Cheap and powerful prototyping tools have become easier to use by non-engineers; it turns them into users as well as self manufactures [4]. We discuss the different aspects of this open innovation process within a „design for disability"" context and suggest the first steps of an iterative co- design methodology bringing together professional designers, occupational therapists and patients. In this paper the authors sketch the holistic framework which starts with the innovation development and the co- creation process between these disciplines.","- co-creation

NO,Designing a diving protocol for thermocline identification using dive computers in Marine Citizen Science,"Dive computers have an important potential for citizen science projects where recreational SCUBA divers can upload the depth temperature profile and the geolocation of the dive to a central database which may provide useful information about the subsurface temperature of the oceans. However, their accuracy may not be adequate and needs to be evaluated. The aim of this study is to assess the accuracy and precision of dive computers and provide guidelines in order to enable their contribution to citizen science projects. Twenty-two dive computers were evaluated during real ocean dives for consistency and scatter in the first phase. In the second phase, the dive computers were immersed in sufficient depth to initiate the dive record inside a precisely controlled sea aquarium while using a calibrated device as a reference. Results indicate that the dive computers do not have the accuracy required for monitoring temperature changes in the oceans, however, they can be used to detect thermoclines if the users follow a specific protocol with specific dive computers. This study enabled the authors to define this protocol based on the results of immersion in two different sea aquarium tanks set to two different temperatures in order to simulate the conditions of a thermocline.","- diver

NO,Displaying bias in sampling effort of data accessed from biodiversity databases using ignorance maps,"Open-access biodiversity databases including mainly citizen science data make temporally and spatially extensive species' observation data available to a wide range of users. Such data have limitations however, which include: sampling bias in favour of recorder distribution, lack of survey effort assessment, and lack of coverage of the distribution of all organisms. These limitations are not always recorded, while any technical assessment or scientific research based on such data should include an evaluation of the uncertainty of its source data and researchers should acknowledge this information in their analysis. The here proposed maps of ignorance are a critical and easy way to implement a tool to not only visually explore the quality of the data, but also to filter out unreliable results.

I present simple algorithms to display ignorance maps as a tool to report the spatial distribution of the bias and lack of sampling effort across a study region. Ignorance scores are expressed solely based on raw data in order to rely on the fewest assumptions possible. Therefore there is no prediction or estimation involved. The rationale is based on the assumption that it is appropriate to use species groups as a surrogate for sampling effort because it is likely that an entire group of species observed by similar methods will share similar bias. Simple algorithms are then used to transform raw data into ignorance scores scaled 0-1 that are easily comparable and scalable. Because of the need to perform calculations over big datasets, simplicity is crucial for web-based implementations on infrastructures for biodiversity information.

With these algorithms, any infrastructure for biodiversity information can offer a quality report of the observations accessed through them. Users can specify a reference taxonomic group and a time frame according to the research question. The potential of this tool lies in the simplicity of its algorithms and in the lack of assumptions made about the bias distribution, giving the user the freedom to tailor analyses to their specific needs.","- Biodiversity database

,Distribution of invasive alien species of Union concern (Regulation (EU) 1143/2014) for the reporting period 2015-2018,"Aims and scope

Member State authorities are required to report on the distribution in their territory of each of the invasive alien species (IAS) of Union concern. These are species with documented biodiversity impacts sensu the European Union Regulation on the prevention and management of the introduction and spread of Invasive Alien Species in Europe (IAS Regulation No 1143/2014) (European Union 2014). This distribution represents the official reporting under Article 24(1) of R.1143/2014 on invasive alien species for the period 2015–2018. Baseline distribution of these species has previously been reported and published (Adriaens et al. 2018, ).

Data were compiled from various datasets holding invasive species observations such as data from research institutes and research projects (9%), citizen science observatories (68%) and a range of other sources (23%) such as governmental agencies, water managers etc. More specifically the dataset includes:

The citizen science recording portals www.waarnemingen.be and www.observation.be which has a specific alert system for IAS where nature volunteers can report their observations (Adriaens et al. 2018);
Data from the Research Institute for Nature and Forest (INBO), the Flemish government institute that coordinates N2000, WFD and BIrd Directive and IAS monitoring in the terrestrial, estuarine and freshwater environment;
Data from the Flemish Environment Agency which performs management of muskrat and invasive water plants in Flanders, gathered with a dedicated smartphone app since 2015;
Data from the Flemish provinces and Rato vzw that manage water plants, muskrat, giant hogweed etc.;
Some smaller datasets from cities;
Data from the Brussels Capital Region from the Brussels Environment data portal;
Plant inventories of the ‘contrats de rivière’ along watercourses in Wallonia, making use of a dedicated application to collect data directly from the field (fulcrum);
The government reporting portals for IAS of the ‘Observatoire wallon de la flore, de la faune et des habitats (Service Public de Wallonie)’;
Some validated data from specific datasets on gbif (iNaturalist, Natusfera, Naturgucker).

Data were normalized using a custom mapping of the original data files to Darwin Core (Wieczorek et al. 2012) where possible. Species names were mapped to the GBIF Backbone Taxonomy (GBIF 2016) using the species API (http://www.gbif.org/developer/species). The mapping was assisted by dedicated software (SMARTIE) which was specifically written for the purpose of aggregating IAS data from various sources. Appropriate selection of records was performed based on the cut-off dates (see data range) and record content validation (see validation procedure). Data were then joined with GRID10k layer Belgium based on GRID10k cellcodes (ETRS_1989_LAEA). The technical format is in line with the guidelines provided to the member states for the compilation of reports on Species Distribution (SD) of Invasive Alien Species of Union concern.

File description

The dataset contains a shapefiles (T1_Belgium_Union_List_Species.shp) with the distribution of the species of Union Concern at 10km2 (European Terrestrial Reference System projection - 1989 ETRS_1989_LAEA) level. The attributes table contains Cellcode (ETRS grid cell code) and Species (scientific name + authority).

Date range

The data reflects the distribution of the IAS of Union concern in Belgium in the first reporting period for the EU Regulation hence comprises observations of Union List invasive species between January 2015 (2015-01-01) and December 2018 (2018-12-31). 

Validation procedure

Record validation was performed to exclude dubious records, wrong identifications etc. This was done based on the IdentificationVerificationStatus field (to which validation information from original data were mapped) if available. In general, non-validated data were not considered. Data were validated in the original datasets based on evidence (e.g. pictures), on the observer’s experience, or based on a set of predefined rules (e.g. automated validation based on geographic filtering). Data from research institutes were generally considered validated. A few casual records of EU list species that were clearly planted were discarded manually. When the original dataset did not mention any validation status, records were not considered validated and therefore not taken into account unless for Chinese mitten crab Eriocheir sinensis, ruddy duck Oxyura jamaicensis, raccoon Procyon lotor, Siberian ground squirrel Tamias sibiricus, sacred ibis Threskiornis aethiopicus, Egyptian goose Alopochen aegyptiaca, Himalayan balsam Impatiens glandulifera, giant hogweed Heracleum mantegazzianum, muskrat Ondatra zibethicus and red-eared slider Trachemys spp. For these species, it was assumed all records were correct as they originate from dedicated sampling (E. sinensis) within research projects, were gathered by public bodies (e.g. muskrat), or represent species that are readily recognizable by people in the field. Data provided by EASIN in the care package and GBIF data were carefully checked.

A visual check was performed on the resulting distribution maps by representatives of the Belgian national scientific council on invasive alien species, an official consultative structure coordinating scientific input and data aggregation between Belgian regions and institutions with regards to technical implementation of the Regulation No 1143/2014 on invasive alien species.

Data providers

The providers of the invasive species data for this exercise (individuals and their respective organizations) are listed in the ""data providers"" section of the dataset metadata. Much of the primary occurrence data that formed the basis for this aggregated dataset will be published as open data on the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF).","- biodiversity

SI!,DocuScooter: An innovative underwater scooter add-on for scuba diving Citizen Science,"In order to obtain robust and measurable data from the marine environment, citizen science projects need user-friendly tools that, during dives, autonomously gather information in an easy, low-cost and integrated way. Data collected from different devices and by different untrained divers must have good estimation of the position where the information has been acquired. With this goal, in the context of the Green Bubbles project, a novel platform, called DocuScooter has been designed and developed. DocuScooter implements all the algorithms to filter and merge data with correct timestamp and position preparing the complete mission report. After the mission, the diver can upload the report on an appropriate web service to produce a 3D documentation. In order to obtain the underwater position during the dive, a tailored device compatible with the platform is also presented. Result of the prototype of the platform and the first results of the position estimation algorithm are presented and discussed.","- Citizen Science

NO,"DoeDat, the Crowdsourcing Platform of Meise Botanic Garden","Herbarium specimens hold a wealth of data about plants; where they come from, where they were collected and by whom. Once digitized, these data can be searched, mapped and compared. However, the information on specimens is often handwritten and even the best software systems cannot read it. This is where we get real value from citizen involvement. Digitizing these data is only possible with the aid of human intelligence.

DoeDat is a multilingual open-source platform for transcription, based upon the DigiVol program of the Australian Museum and Atlas of Living Australia. DoeDat is a product of our digitization project Digital Access to Cultural Heritage Collections (DOE!), funded by the Flemish Government. DoeDat is about creating data and also, 'Doe Dat' means 'do that' in Dutch.

DoeDat will help us digitize our collections, and will also give the public the chance to take an active part in the process. We aim to build a community of enthusiastic online volunteers who will help us liberate botanical data from specimen labels and documents. We launched the platform on Science Day and within two months, more than one hundred volunteers had transcribed more than 4,000 specimens.

NO,Embedding Computer Vision in Citizen Science,"The rapid rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods has presented new opportunities for those who work with biodiversity data. Computer vision, in particular where computers can be trained to identify species in digital photographs, has significant potential to address a number of existing challenges in citizen science.

The Biological Records Centre (www.brc.ac.uk) has been a central focus for terrestrial and freshwater citizen science in the United Kingdom for over 50 years. We will present our research on how computer vision can be embedded in citizen science, addressing three important questions.

How can contextual information, such as time of year, be included in computer vision? A naturalist will use a wealth of ecological knowledge about species in combination with information about where and when the image was taken to augment their decision making; we should emulate this in our AI. How can citizen scientists be best supported by computer vision? Our ambition is not to replace identification skills with AI but to use AI to support the learning process. How can computer vision support our limited resource of expert verifiers as data volumes increase? We receive more and more data each year, which puts a greater demand on our expert verifiers, who review all records to ensure data quality. We have been exploring how computer vision can lighten this workload.

We will present work that addresses these questions including: developing machine learning techniques that incorporate ecological information as well as images to arrive at a species classification; co-designing an identification tool to help farmers identify flowers beneficial to wildlife; and assessing the optimal combination of computer vision and expert verification to improve our verification systems.","- AI

NO,Enabling Open Science: Wikidata for Research,"Wiki4R will create an innovative virtual research environment (VRE) for Open Science at scale, engaging both professional researchers and citizen data scientists in new and potentially transformative forms of collaboration. It is based on the realizations that (1) the structured parts of the Web itself can be regarded as a VRE, (2) such environments depend on communities, (3) closed environments are limited in their capacity to nurture thriving communities. Wiki4R will therefore integrate Wikidata, the multilingual semantic backbone behind Wikipedia, into existing research processes to enable transdisciplinary research and reduce fragmentation of research in and outside Europe. By establishing a central shared information node, research data can be linked and annotated into knowledge. Despite occasional uses of Wikipedia or Wikidata in research, significant barriers to broader adoption in the sciences or digital humanities exist, including lack of integration into existing research processes and inadequate handling of provenances. The proposed actions include providing best practices and tools for semantic mapping, adoption of citation and author identifiers, interoperability layers for integration with existing research environments, and the development of policies for information quality and interchange. The effectiveness of the actions will be tested in pilot use cases. Unforeseen barriers will be investigated and documented. We will promote the adoption of Wiki4R by making it easy to use and integrate, demonstrate the applicability in selected research domains, and provide diverse training opportunities. Wiki4R leverages the expertise gained in Europe through the Wikidata and DBpedia projects to further strengthen the established virtual community of 14000 people.

NO,Energy Conscious Builder Design Pattern with C# and Intermediate Language,"Design Patterns have gained more and more acceptances since their emerging in software development world last decade and become another de facto standard of essential knowledge for Object-Oriented Programming developers nowadays. Their target usage, from the beginning, was for regular computers, so, minimizing power consumption had never been a concern. However, in this decade, demands of more complicated software for running on mobile devices has grown rapidly as the much higher performance portable gadgets have been supplied to the market continuously. To get along with time to market that is business reason, the section of software development for power conscious, battery, devices has shifted itself from using specific low-level languages to higher level ones. Currently, complicated software running on mobile devices are often developed by high level languages those support OOP concepts. These cause the trend of embracing Design Patterns to mobile world. However, using Design Patterns directly in software development for power conscious systems is not recommended because they were not originally designed for such environment. This paper demonstrates the adapted Design Pattern for power limitation system. Because there are numerous original design patterns, it is not possible to mention the whole at once. So, this paper focuses only in creating Energy Conscious version of existing regular ""Builder Pattern"" to be appropriated for developing low power consumption software.","- Design Patterns

NO,Enhancing Monitoring and Control of the Fall Armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda) in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo) by Citizen Science.,"The Fall Armyworm (FAW) (Spodoptera frugiperda - Lepidoptera) is an insect that feeds on more than 80 plant species and causes major damage to economically important crops including maize, rice or sugarcane. While in cooler climates development slows down to one or a few generations per year because frost kills the insect, in Africa, the FAW moths can travel hundreds of kilometers per night and reproduce every 1–2 months, which helped the pest spread rapidly. Environmental and climatic analyses of Africa show that the FAW is likely to build permanent and significant populations in West and Southern Africa, spreading to other regions when weather or temperatures are favourable.

Located in the Central Africa, the DR Congo is now facing this challenge. Since 2016, the FAW has caused important yield losses (up to 80% in 4 regions) where maize is cultivated. Almost 50 of the 147 administrative territories have been affected. The damage resulted in a surge in commodity prices (the price of a 25 kg bag of corn rose from $ 10 to $ 30).

Pesticides and genetically modified (GM) crops could be the main methods of control but many farmers in the DR Congo do not yet plant GM crops. Biopesticides (including virus-based and Bacillus thuringiensis), mass rearing and release of parasitoids and predators are  low-risk options, but remain prohibitive to many small-scale farmers; subsidies or government-funded interventions are unavailable.

In all cases, further research is needed across the country, through national and regional institutes, to understand the insect's lifecycle stages and feeding habits. A widespread communications programme is necessary to teach farmers how to monitor and identify the pest. There is a clear need for information resources about FAW, which can help inform and keep all interested parties up-to-date on the latest news regarding spread, management research, diagnostic protocols for monitoring and early detection techniques of FAW.

However, faced with a political will shifted to other priorities, no formal program to collect data to characterize this pest has been initiated and studies that provided current data are facing the following main challenges: (i) the national territory is too vast (more than 2,345,000 km2) and impossible to cover by these types of studies, (ii) insects are known under several common names (complicated by >240 languages) or only one name is used to identify taxonomically distant species; (iii) historical data are very hard to find (the oral tradition being preferred to writing); (iv) the absence of reference collections and the lack of specialists; (v) the difficulty of finding geo-referenced data (with the risk associated in its collection).

An effective alternative to circumvent these difficulties and to gather data is promoting citizen science. Such research programs involving scientists and the participation of amateurs or interested volunteer citizens within local populations would constitute a set of data across the country and over a longer period than what has been done so far. With the development of free software and mobile applications, non-specialists could, based on standards and protocols validated by scientists, be involved in the digitization of specimens observed or identification of insect species through graphical user interfaces; help clarify the correspondence between vernacular names and scientific names; participate in habitat monitoring of insect species; or help collecting geo-referenced data via mobile phone. These field-based research activities can be conducted without great expense and will offer professionals and non-professionals a collaborative ground to contribute together toward advances in monitoring and knowledge of FAW (and many other pests) in the DR Congo.","- Maize

NO,Enriching Europeana: the Crowdsourcing Platform of the European Library,"As the digital platform for cultural heritage, the Europeana Collections preserve over 50 million digitised items from various libraries, museums and other cultural institutions. With digitisation comes the challenge of transforming these materials into useful and searchable information sources. This is particularly problematic for cultural heritage objects with handwritten texts. Digital images of handwritten documents are holding a lot of information that is not included in the metadata provided. The texts are difficult to decipher and it takes a lot of time to read, search and find them. Currently there are no accurate technical solutions for this problem. Automated Handwriting Recognition is a very difficult and error-prone task and technical solutions with high accuracy for character recognition on heterogeneous datasets are not available yet. Due to the lack of machine-interpretable text, it is not possible to perform a search based on the informational content and the covered topics. Similarly, it is presently not possible to use advanced AI technologies for performing exact automatic text processing. Thus, even with increasing automation, the transition from paper format into digitised items is not possible without human resources.

The Enriching Europeana project fills this gap by developing a crowdsourcing platform that will enable citizen science transcription and enrichment campaigns for a wide variety of digital heritage collections in the Europeana library. The aim is, on the one hand, to transcribe, annotate and translate content that is currently only available in image formats and, on the other hand, to improve the accessibility of Europeana content for a diverse group of people. Manual transcription of text material generates high-accuracy resources, supports a better understanding of materials and allows further reuse. It also facilitates the extraction of additional information such as dates, locations, subjects depicted (e.g. in the case of photos or illustrations) and relations with other resources. The newly created information will be integrated with the original collections and made available for the public user in the portals of Europeana, aggregators and content providers. By round-tripping enriched metadata and transcriptions, the Europeana metadata database will be improved and the improvements will be sustained.

The Enriching Europeana platform can be used by non-specialist end users: transcription and enrichment will become an easy, enjoyable and engaging task to perform and users will take part through gamification with competitions, ranking lists, levels and rewards. In order to bring a mixed user base together and to promote greater cross-generational cooperation in crowdsourcing activities, events, called ‘Transcribathons’, will be held during the lifetime of the Enriching Europeana project. A Transcribathon is a marathon-like competition where people form teams and compete against each other in the transcription of selected material within a fixed time. These events provide both a discussion platform and a learning platform.

European citizens will be able to make a meaningful contribution to their shared heritage through joining in the enrichment, transcription and translation activities of Enriching Europeana. By furthering the access to cultural heritage, their personal involvement holds a central role in the formation of European historical narratives.",,presentation,Presentation,,2019-06-28,10.5281/zenodo.3259732,3259732,10.5281/zenodo.3259733,3259733,"- Chung, Hui Ting",

Abstract
With a million described species and more than half a billion preserved specimens, the large scale of insect collections is unequaled by those of any other group. Advances in genomics, collection digitization, and imaging have begun to more fully harness the power that such large data stores can provide. These new approaches and technologies have transformed how entomological collections are managed and utilized. While genomic research has fundamentally changed the way many specimens are collected and curated, advances in technology have shown promise for extracting sequence data from the vast holdings already in museums. Efforts to mainstream specimen digitization have taken root and have accelerated traditional taxonomic studies as well as distribution modeling and global change research. Emerging imaging technologies such as microcomputed tomography and confocal laser scanning microscopy are changing how morphology can be investigated. This review provides an overview of how the realization of big data has transformed our field and what may lie in store.

NO,eOceans dive-logs for science and conservation: a case study of sharks in Thailand,"Many marine animals around the world are threatened by a variety of anthropogenic activities, yet there is often a paucity of data to monitor patterns in abundance and distribution or to evaluate human interventions. The new citizen science program eOceans helps to fill this gap by gathering observations of various marine animals from worldwide ocean explorers. In 2012, a dedicated Thailand-wide census of sharks, and other animals, began as collaboration between eOceans scientists and the dive tourism industry. Using the observations from 9,524 dives (9,357 hours underwater) logged by >169 divers on 153 sites, we describe the spatial and temporal patterns of sharks in coastal Thailand. A total of 12 shark species were encountered, most commonly (67%) as individuals, and were observed on 11% of all dives, on 59% of sites, in all months and years. The two most frequently encountered species were blacktip reef (Carcharhinus melanopterus) and leopard sharks (Stegostoma fasciatum). Many species had peak encounter rates in summer, but aggregated in various seasons in different years. Mating events and nursery sites were observed rarely, and only for blacktip reef and whitetip reef (Triaenodon obesus) sharks. These results could be of value to species- or region-specific biologists, ecologists and fisheries scientists, as well as to managers and policy makers that could use the findings to monitor future trends and prioritize conservation strategies. Moreover, this study highlights the value that collaborative eOceans citizen science projects could have in support of marine science, management and conservation efforts worldwide.","- Citizen science

NO,Evaluating Methods for Transcribing Specimen Labels,"Distributed Systems of Scientific Collections (DiSSCo) a pan-European Research Infrastructure will facilitate the production of tens of millions of digital images of natural history specimens each year. The labels of these specimens contain valuable information for research, but their transcription can be difficult and time-consuming, with often hard to read handwritten labels. Whilst accurate label transcription is only one step along the way to create a specimen record fit for different research uses, it is an extremely important one. It would be very time-consuming to have to return to recheck label information for even a very small proportion of specimens. Once a specimen label is transcribed correctly, it becomes much easier to enhance the record with additional information from other sources, e.g. from literature or collector itineraries. It also becomes feasible to determine the point of collection from the textual information on the label by a process known as georeferencing, or even to find inaccuracies within the label itself.

Under the auspices of the project Innovation and Consolidation for Large Scale Digitisation of Natural Heritage (ICEDIG), we compared different manual approaches to transcription of collection labels. Using herbarium specimens as an example, the quality of transcribed data by:

in-house trained institute staff, outsourcing to a commercial company or transcription by the general public through online crowdsourcing platforms was compared through two transcription pilots.

The first pilot consisted of 200 Solanum specimen images from the Royal Botanic Gardens Kew in the UK and 200 from Meise Botanic Garden in Belgium. This particular genus was chosen as both institutes had specimens from which the label data had already been transcribed through the digitisation company Picturae, completed by Alembo. The Kew specimens had also been transcribed in-house by staff employed as digitisation officers or curators and by an independant researcher. The images from both institutes were uploaded to two crowdsourcing platforms: DigiVol and DoeDat. In a second pilot, multiple European institutions holding botanical collections were approached to provide a sample of 200 digitally imaged herbarium sheet specimens to upload to multiple crowdsourcing platforms. Specimens from 7 institutions were uploaded for transcription to 5 different crowdsourcing platforms: DigiVol, DoeDat, Die Herbonauten, Les Herbonautes and Notes from Nature.

For both pilots, key transcription data were assessed and common errors in label transcription identified. Reasons for these errors will be discussed along with possible mechanisms to improve the accuracy of the transcriptions. The need for standards for transcription is identified and recommendations made.","- data capture

NO,"FinBIF: An all-embracing, integrated, cross-sectoral biodiversity data infrastructure","The service model of the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) is being implemented in an increasing number of national biodiversity (BD) data services. While GBIF already shares >109 data points, national initiatives are an essential component: increase in GBIF-mediated data relies on national data mobilisation and GBIF is not optimised to support local use. The Finnish Biodiversity Information Facility (FinBIF), initiated in 2012 and operational since late 2016, is one of the more recent examples of national BD research infrastructures (RIs) – and arguably among the most comprehensive. Here, we describe FinBIF's development and service integration, and provide a model approach for the construction of all-inclusive national BD RIs.

FinBIF integrates a wide array of BD RI approaches under the same umbrella. These include large-scale and multi-technology digitisation of natural history collections; building a national DNA barcode reference library and linking it to species occurrence data; citizen science platforms enabling recording, managing and sharing of observation data; management and sharing of restricted data among authorities; community-driven species identification support; an e-learning environment for species identification; and IUCN Red Listing (Fig. 1).

FinBIF's aims are to accelerate digitisation, mobilisation, and distribution of biodiversity data and to boost their use in research and education, environmental administration, and the private sector. The core functionalities of FinBIF were built in a 3.5-year project (01/2015–06/2018) by a consortium of four university-based natural history collection facilities led by the Finnish Museum of Natural History Luomus. Close to 30% of the total funding was granted through the Finnish Research Infrastructures programme (FIRI) governed by the national research council and based on scientific excellence. Government funds for productivity enhancement in state administration covered c.40 % of the development and the rest was self-financed by the implementing consortium of organisations that have both a research and an education mission.

The cross-sectoral scope of FinBIF has led to rapid uptake and a broad user base of its functionalities and services. Not only researchers but also administrative authorities, various enterprises and a large number of private citizens show a significant interest in the RI (Table 1).

FinBIF is now in its second construction cycle (2019–2022), funded through the FIRI programme and, thus, focused on researcher services. The work programme includes integration of tools for data management in ecological restoration and e-Lab tools for spatial analyses, morphometric analysis of 3D images, species identification from sound recordings, and metagenomics analyses.","- administration

NO,Finnish Biodiversity Information Facility - Improving the Taxonomic Coverage and Deepening the Information Content Through Collaboration,"The Finnish Biodiversity Information Facility FinBIF  (LINK: species.fi), operational since late 2016, is one of the more recent examples of comprehensive, all-inclusive national biodiversity research infrastructures. FinBIF integrates a wide array of biodiversity information approaches under the same umbrella. These include species information Fig. 1 (e.g. descriptions, photos and administrative attributes); citizen science platforms enabling recording, managing and sharing of observation data; an e-learning environment for species identification; management and sharing of restricted data among authorities; building a national DNA barcode reference library and linking it to species occurrence data; community-driven species identification support; large-scale and multi-technology digitisation of natural history collections; and IUCN Red Listing to conduct a periodic national assesment of the status of the threatened species.

To improve the taxonomic coverage and the content of species information, FinBIF is starting a process to collaborate with the species information community at large, in order to collate already existing but not yet openly distributed information. This also means digitisation of information from analogue sources. In addition, the attempt is to join forces with Scandinavian counterparts, namely Artdatabanken (LINK: https://www.artdatabanken.se/) and Artsdatabanken (LINK: https://www.artsdatabanken.no/), for more efficient knowledge exchange within the countries sharing the same biogeographical region and thus similar species composition. The aim is also to reach politically high level agreement for deeper and wider commitment to collaborate in compiling, digitising and sharing relevant biodiversity information over the national borders. ","- biodiversity informatics

NO,Finnish Citizen Science Based Bird Monitoring Schemes and User Interfaces in FinBIF,"Monitoring of bird populations is based primarily on volunteer birdwatcher activity in Finland. Hence, development of online user interfaces and data availability have become a priority in order to encourage bird watchers to participate in monitoring schemes.

Most Finnish bird monitoring is managed by the Finnish Museum of Natural History LUOMUS, which oversees a wide spectrum of long-running programs including: a bird ringing (banding) scheme running since 1913, a winter bird census established in 1956, a breeding bird census initiated in 1975, a raptor monitoring program started in 1982, and, a nest recording scheme ongoing since the 1940s. In 2018, more than 1,500 volunteer birdwatchers participated in LUOMUS bird monitoring schemes. Data gathered from these programs constitute our basis of knowledge on national bird populations and demographic trends and are actively incorporated in conservation, scientific, land-use planning, and administrative purposes in Finland. In principle, all data are open and freely accessible via the Finnish Biodiversity Information Facility (FinBIF), however, the law prohibits authorities from distributing species occurrence data if this causes an increased threat to certain endangered species. Accordingly, sensitive data details are not available.

Reporting valuable fieldwork data can sometimes be demanding. As such, developing user-friendly interfaces for data portals is critical to facilitating volunteer activity. Essential tools for volunteers include a simple login, smooth and augmented data input, automated validation of data, and, perhaps most importantly, ease of access to up-to-date data. Crucial to administrators are system reliability, operability, and easy data management. Comprehensive data validation and visualization tools and extensive search functions aid in revealing errors and thereby increase data quality. Finally, simple query tools and easy access to data are of paramount importance for smooth abd flexible use of the data.

Keeping in mind these demands, we have developed the main FinBIF platform and project-specific user interfaces in order to facilitate participation in bird monitoring programs. We will introduce these user interfaces and our achievements and challenges in the development process.","- bird monitoring

NO,Fitness for Use: The BDQIG aims for improved Stability and Consistency,"The process of choosing data for a project and then determining what subset of records are suitable for use has become one of the most important concerns for biodiversity researchers in the 21st century. The rise of large data aggregators such as GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facility), iDigBio (Integrated Digitized Biocollections), the ALA (Atlas of Living Australia) and its many clones, OBIS (Ocean Biogeographic Information System), SIBBr (Sistema de Informação sobre a Biodiversidade Brasileria), CRIA (Centro de Referência em Informação Ambiental) and many others has made access to large volumes of data easier, but choosing which data are fit for use remains a more difficult task. There has been no consistency between the various aggregators on how best to clean and document the quality – how tests are run, or how annotations are stored and reported. Feedback to data custodians on possible errors has been minimal, inconsistent, and adherence to recommendations and controlled vocabularies (where they exist) has been haphazard to say the least.

The TDWG Data Quality Interest Group is addressing these issues, either alone or in conjunction with other Interest Groups (Annotations, Darwin Core, Invasive Species, Citizen Science and Vocabulary Maintenance) to develop a framework, tests and assertions, use cases and controlled vocabularies. The Interest Group is also working closely with the data aggregators toward consistent implementations. The practical work is being done through five Task Groups. A published framework is leading to a user-friendly Fitness for Use Backbone (FFUB) and data quality profiles by which users can document the quality they need for a project. A standard set of core tests and assertions has been developed around the Darwin Core standard and are currently being tested and integrated into several aggregators. A use case library has been compiled and these cases will lead to themed data quality profiles as part of the FFUB. Two new Task Groups are being established to develop controlled vocabularies to address the inconsistencies in values of at least 40 Darwin Core terms. These inconsistencies make the evaluation of fitness for use far more difficult than achieved by using controlled vocabularies. The first TG is looking at vocabularies generally, while the second is looking at those just pertaining to Invasive Species.

It is not just the aggregators though that are the stakeholders in this work. The data custodians and even the collectors have a vested interest in ensuring their data and metadata are of highest quality and therefore seeing their data used widely. It is only after aggregation that many uses of the data become apparent, and most collectors aren't aware of these uses at the time of collecting. Issues of data quality at the time of collection can later restrict the range of later uses of the data.  Feeding back information to the data custodians from users and aggregators on suspect records is essential, and this is where annotations and reporting back on the results of tests conducted by aggregators is important. The project is also generating standard code and test data for the tests and assertions so that data custodians can readily integrate them into their own procedures. It is far cheaper to correct errors at the source than try and rectify them further down the line.

A lot of progress has been made, but we still have a long way to go – join us in making biodiversity data quality a product of which we can all be proud.","- TDWG BDQIG ""Data Quality"" ""Fitness for Use"" Framework ""Tests and Assertions"" quality vocabularies",publication,Journal article,article,2017-08-14,,1140499,10.3897/tdwgproceedings.1.20240,1140500,"- Chapman, Arthur

,FOSTER Open Science to Scientific Research,"The 10 min lesson is part of an e-learning short course on general introduction to the various components and philosophies of Open Science, that can directly enrich each step of the scholarly lifecycle (Open Notebook Science, OpenData, Open Research Software, Open Access). The overall objective of the course is to provide an introduction to why Open Science is essential to rigorous, reproducible and transparent research, as well as to future research evaluation criteria focused on societal impact.

Open Science is the practice of science in such a way that others can collaborate and contribute, where research data, lab notes and other research processes are freely available, under terms that enable reuse, redistribution and reproduction of the research and its underlying data and methods.

The learning outcomes of this lesson are:

Understand the relevance of OS in relation to research integrity, reproducibility and impact;

NO,From Dickens to Data Science - Making the Case for Transcendental Information Cascades,"In this talk I introduce Transcendental Information Cascades, a method to understand the temporal dynamics of naturally occurring complex systems through the lens of a specific kind of spatio-temporal network that represents information token recurrence. The method suits very well for exploratory data analysis when it is unknown what is going on at the very low levels of a system's dynamics, and allows switching between looking at individual events or accumulated event sequences. I will present one application of this method in a digital humanities project where we analysed the entire corpus of Charles Dickens's novels and discuss the potential it has for other application areas such as the analysis of brain wave recordings, patent mining or the study of online communities for example.","- digital humanities

NO,Gamified Crowdsourcing for Disaster Risk Management,"Nowadays, the number and the magnitude of natural hazards are increasing. During emergency situations different forms of cooperation take place, including the crowdsourcing, which is envisioned by many Disaster Risk Management approaches to enable citizens to support the emergency management process. However, crowdsourcing is a challenging paradigm as it requires a sustained engagement in order to be effective. In this paper we propose a gamification strategy for crowdsourced Disaster Risk Management services aimed to increase awareness, engagement, and change people behaviors.","- Gamification

NO,Global Biodiversity Knowledge Commons and Civil Society of the Global South,"In our times of challenged relationships between nature and culture, it is essential that biodiversity conservation in biodiversity-rich areas of the world is ceded priority with recognised urgency.  The Convention on Biological Diversity's (CBD) Aichi Target 19 states that ""By 2020, knowledge, the science base and technologies relating to biodiversity, its values, functioning, status and trends, and the consequences of its loss, are improved, widely shared and transferred, and applied.""  One of the significant impediments mentioned in achieving the goals of CBD is lack of scientific information, which is substantiated by studies that highlight various gaps such as taxonomic, thematic, spatial and temporal biases in the global knowledge on biodiversity. Behind such global approaches to knowledge and its production, there is a need to establish a biodiversity knowledge commons at the global, regional and national scales. 

Biodiversity informatics is tightly integrated with both fundamental biological sciences and the most recent advances in information technology, which gives it a unique blended quality of an academic discipline and technological practice. This has generated much enthusiasm, where rapid technological progress in biodiversity informatics is witnessed along with large scale threats to biodiversity. Such enthusiastic efforts for biodiversity informatics data and tools, as Peterson et al. (2010) argues, need to be integrated with other overall conceptual frameworks, particularly within ecology and evolutionary biology. In the context of the Global South, it is important to place the practice and knowledge of biodiversity informatics within the framework of sustainable development, biodiversity conservation, traditional knowledge and development aspirations. 

The emphasis on growth, in the current global economic paradigm, has meant undue stress on natural resources. State institutions in the Global South, responsible for natural resource and biodiversity conservation, are often found to be silent if not supportive of the dominant development policies. Civil society groups and grass-roots level organisations have taken the lead in documenting biodiversity at relevant scales, to argue for conservation. It is imperative that citizen science has a growing role to play in environmental assessments (Chandler et al. 2016), mediated through biodiversity informatics. By participating in knowledge production and overcoming the barriers of scientific legitimacy by collaborating with experts in scientific institutions, civil society science groups play a role in changing the power relations by developing the means to generate independent knowledge (Jalbert 2016), contributing towards a global knowledge commons. 

Limiting factors such as a data sharing culture, coping with quickly evolving technologies and capabilities, inhibit communities in the Global South from participating in building a global biodiversity knowledge commons. The historically skewed accumulation of knowledge on biodiversity of the Global South in northern institutions facilitates their influence of contemporary global policies and allocation of resources. Apart from a few exceptions, such as Biodiversity Information for Development, JRS Foundation's African efforts and Critical Ecosytem Partnership Fund's investments in biodiversity hotspots, one does not see any encouraging shifts in this cyclic trend, which will not be effective in addressing the biases in global biodiversity knowledge. As much as the development of the discipline and practice of biodiversity informatics at different scales is important, it is equally necessary to address such structural aspects that affect the constitution of the global biodiversity knowledge commons and its relevance to the communities in the Global South.","- biodiversity informatics

NO,"GLOBIS-B Position Paper for Policymakers on the Potential Solutions to Scientific, Technical and Legal Interoperability Issues","The concept of Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBVs) was introduced to harmonize and standardize biodiversity data from disparate sources for capturing the minimum set of critical variables required to study, report and manage biodiversity change. Scientific and technical challenges need to be met for building global EBV data products even for the most “classic” EBVs with which biodiversity experts (in particular, conservation biologists) are traditionally familiarized, such as ‘species distribution’ or ‘population abundance’. These challenges imply, e.g. the need (i) to develop tools and models for combining heterogeneous, multi-source datasets and filling data gaps in geographic, temporal and taxonomic coverage; (ii) to integrate new methods and technologies for data collection such as sensor networks, DNA-based techniques, and satellite remote sensing; (iii) to solve major technical issues related to data product structure, data storage, execution of workflows, and the production process/cycle as well as approaching technical interoperability among research infrastructures, or (v) to achieve semantic interoperability by adopting standards and tools for capturing consistent metadata. Since all EBVs are produced from heterogeneous types of data, such as those provided by natural history collections, national and international monitoring programs, research surveys, or citizen science initiatives, from the law & policy perspective the challenges include mainly three sets of problems:

(1) providing frameworks for making scientific and technically sound authoritative decisions for the building of EBV products;

(2) ensuring legal interoperability by endorsing open data or data that are free from restrictions on access, use, modification, and sharing; and

(3) providing a framework for making authoritative decisions on minimum requirements of data policies attached to the data used in EBV products and the products themselves along the workflows embedded in the continuum of the EBV production processes since a) individual researchers and teams act as if data were proprietary, and the use of data is not necessarily designated as open; b) there is a high possibility that EBV products may have to be built using data from providers with incompatible data policies (e.g. using of different datasets for the same species from providers with different data policies) even if intended to be open and non proprietary; and c) the mere existence of data, datasets and other derivative products is built on practices of Big Data management techniques (e.g. citizen science) that may create other conditions or legal limitations to their use and re-use.

This paper addresses these three different law & policy issues in order to elaborate a set of recommendations for all actors, from individual scientists to institutions involved in the provision of raw data to the EBVs products all along the continuum between primary data observations (‘raw data’) and synthetic or derived indices (‘indicators’) to final products development for EBVs calculations.","- Biodiversity informatics

NO,Green Pioneers: Raising awareness of invasive plants for all ages,"When researchers and managers are asked to rank the issues that prevent adequate control of invasive species, lack of public awareness is at the top of the list (Dehnen‐Schmutz et al. 2018). It is therefore imperative to raise the general public's awareness of the potential risks of introducing alien species into the wild.

Green Pioneers, a citizen science project funded by the Flemish Government, (Fig. 1) aims to address this issue in Belgium, across age groups.

The project aims to

Create awareness on invasive species, highlighting how invasions can be avoided and how to mitigate their impact.

Improve communication between citizens and scientists on conservation and invasive plant species.

Augment the quality and quantity of data on invasive species.

The project is developing three kinds of activity, specifically to attract a broad demographic:

- 'Young Pioneers', by developing tools for teachers in science, technology, engineering and mathemathics for school children from 12-15 years old.

- 'Online Pioneers', through our online citizen science platform DoeDat.be, by helping with the transcription of label information on herbarium specimens,

- and 'Visiteers', by inviting companies and working age people to help us in the collection and to inform them about invasive species.

Finally, we will be organizing a BioBlitz in spring 2020 at Meise Botanic Garden where we will celebrate plants and all our Green Pioneers, while also spreading the message of invasive plant awareness. During our 48 hour BioBlitz, scientists, volunteers and citizens are workig together to survey the biodiversity of our Botanic Garden.

Ultimately, Green Pioneers aim to encourage recording of alien species by amateur botanists and create a generation of responsible gardeners who understand the consequences of releasing invasive alien plants into the wild.","- citizen science

Los gobiernos, las instituciones y las asociaciones profesionales siguen apoyando iniciativas cada vez mejor entendidas por los investigadores y más reconocidas por los ciudadanos. Todo el mundo está de acuerdo en que la ciencia también es cultura.  Sin embargo, la ciencia ciudadana en general no involucra verdaderamente los conocimientos o experiencias de quienes se involucran. Y es que, en efecto, la mayor parte de los proyectos son concebidos en la academia y posteriormente abiertos  a la contribución altruista de los voluntarios. La ciencia ciudadana, en consecuencia, puede ser muy relevante para el conocimiento de la biodiversidad, las migraciones de pájaros o la forma de las galaxias, pero influye de forma muy superficial en las vidas de quienes participan en ella.

The current work aims to develop a centralized air quality data hub that enables citizens to contribute to air quality monitoring. In this work, data from official air quality monitoring stations are combined with air pollution estimates from sky-depicting photos and from low-cost sensing devices that citizens build on their own so that citizens receive improved information about the quality of the air they breathe. Additionally, a data fusion algorithm merges air quality information from various sources to provide information in areas where no air quality measurements exist.","- air pollution

NO,HamSCI and the 2017 Total Solar Eclipse,"On 21 August 2017, a total solar eclipse will cause the shadow of the moon to traverse the United States from Oregon to South Carolina in just over 90 minutes.

The sudden absence of sunlight due to the eclipse, especially solar UV and x-rays, provides an impulse function to the upper atmosphere that modifies the neutral dynamics, plasma concentrations, and related properties. In spite of more than 60 years of research, open questions remain regarding eclipse-induced ionospheric impacts. Ham radio operators’ advanced technical skills and inherent interest in ionospheric science make the amateur radio community ideal for contributing to and participating in large-scale ionospheric sounding experiments. This paper describes the Solar Eclipse QSO Party (SEQP), the HF Wideband Recording Experiment, and the Eclipse Frequency Measurement Test (FMT), three amateur radio experiments designed to study the 2017 total solar eclipse. These experiments are coordinated by HamSCI, the Ham radio Science Citizen Investigation, a citizen science organization that connects the amateur radio community to the professional space science research community for mutual benefit","- citizen science

NO,How Citizen Science is Reinforcing the Forming of a Bottom-Up National Biodiversity Open Data Culture: Our progress on an island in the Western Pacific region - Taiwan,"The importance of a data exchanging culture accompanied by a supporting bioinformatic system is widely praised as an aid to sustainable development. Yet this is not always implemented as a top-down procedure in every governing environment. Common obstacles include lack of resources, lack of support from decision-makers, and lack of recognition from data-providers. Using citizen science (hereafter CS), which assumes a spirit of public information sharing, we demonstrate how CS can be a critical tool to help database managers overcome this difficulty.

CS data contributes to impressively over 70% of the currently 4.5 million openly distributed occurrence data in Taiwan. Although CS projects emerged much earlier in a few taxa, such as Aves and Anura, CS was unknown to the wider public and politicians in the region until 2009. This was probably due to the combination of the popularity of social media and improvements to wifi connections, which brought discoveries and impacts of CS data to the news spotlight. Such cases include roadkill projects that aided rabies-outbreak control, and amateur bird records that helped downscale the conflict between solar energy deployment and migratory wetland bird conservation. These cases also created feedback on the call for more data to be open, an effect that was prominent from project managers in other CS communities, the previously reluctant expert researcher communities, and even placed pressure on data policy of several conservation agencies which previously were not supportive of open data.

The inclusion of CS programs is also critical in forming alliances between agencies that were responsible for promoting and building the biodiversity informatics system. Previously, financial and human resources for such systems are split across agencies. However, in terms of building up a cutting edge biodiversity information service platform, or empowerment of human resources to handle the rapidly growing amount of data, joint partnerships across government agencies is then necessary. CS brings the spotlight of government efforts to the people, which is an important strategy to maintain support from top decision-makers and politicians, who mostly rely on public votes in a democratic society. Currently, the national node of the Global Biodiversity Information Facility in Taiwan, the administration for conservation in Taiwan, and the main biodiversity consultancy in Taiwan have teamed up, answering the call for sharing data for a better future.

As a tribute to the CS projects, a biodiversity informatics system named Taiwan Biodiversity Network, is now enhancing its ability as a platform to promote data usage and provide technical aid to CS programs. Data visualization projects such as ""Coldspots"" pointed out regions that lack data, which can be used to decide where to focus efforts for the next field surveys. Online CS data platforms, such as Taiwan Reptile Report Program, are also working to ease the previously intensive efforts that project managers needed to contribute to run event-based monitoring. Combined, these developments form a cultural and technical basis for the implementation of multi-taxa atlas projects, which was made possible by the mainstreaming of open data culture and biodiversity awareness through citizen science projects.","- volunteers

NO,Hyperlop Transportation System,"As we know that there are four modes of transportation are, rail, road, water, and air. These modes of transport tend to be either relatively slow (e.g., road and water), expensive (e.g., air), or a combination of relatively slow and expensive (i.e., rail). Hyper loop is a new mode of transport that seeks to change this paradigm by being both fast and inexpensive for people and goods. Hyperloop is also unique in that it is an open design concept, similar to Linux. Feedback is desired from the community that can help advance the Hyperloop design and bring it from concept to reality. Hyperloop consists of a low pressure tube with capsules that are transported at both low and high speeds throughout the length of the tube. The capsules are supported on a cushion of air, featuring pressurized air and aerodynamic lift. The capsules are accelerated via a magnetic linear accelerator affixed at various stations on the low pressure tube with rotors contained in each capsule. Passengers may enter and exit Hyperloop at stations located either at the ends of the tube, or branches along the tube length. In this study, the initial route, preliminary design, and logistics of the Hyperloop transportation system have been derived. The system consists of capsules that travel between Los Angeles, California and San Francisco, California. The total one-way trip time is 35 minutes from county line to county line. The capsules leave on average every 2 minutes from each terminal carrying 28 people each (as often as every 30 seconds during rush hour and less frequently at night). This gives a total of 7.4 million people per tube that can be transported each year on Hyperloop. The total cost of Hyperloop is under $6 billion USD for two one-way tubes and 40 capsules. Amortizing this capital cost over 20 years and adding daily operational costs gives a total of $20 USD plus operating costs per one-way ticket on the passenger Hyperloop.","- Hyperloop, Eloun Musk, Compressor, Tubes",publication,Journal article,article,2019-04-30,10.5281/zenodo.3355938,3355938,10.5281/zenodo.3355939,3355939,"- Mahajan S.M

NO,Implementation of Conceptual Real-Time Embedded Functional Design via Drive-by-Wire ECU Development,"Design concepts of real-time embedded system can be realized initially by introducing novel design approaches. In this literature, model based design approach and in-the-loop testing were employed early in the conceptual and preliminary phase to formulate design requirements and perform quick real-time verification. The design and analysis methodology includes simulation analysis, model based testing, and in-the-loop testing. The design of conceptual driveby- wire, or DBW, algorithm for electronic control unit, or ECU, was presented to demonstrate the conceptual design process, analysis, and functionality evaluation. The concepts of DBW ECU function can be implemented in the vehicle system to improve electric vehicle, or EV, conversion drivability. However, within a new development process, conceptual ECU functions and parameters are needed to be evaluated. As a result, the testing system was employed to support conceptual DBW ECU functions evaluation. For the current setup, the system components were consisted of actual DBW ECU hardware, electric vehicle models, and control area network or CAN protocol. The vehicle models and CAN bus interface were both implemented as real-time applications where ECU and CAN protocol functionality were verified according to the design requirements. The proposed system could potentially benefit in performing rapid real-time analysis of design parameters for conceptual system or software algorithm development.","- Drive-by-wire ECU

NO,Implementation of Geo-Crowdsourcing Mobile Applications in e-Government of V4 Countries: A State-of-the-Art Survey,"In recent years, citizens have become an important source of geographic information and, therefore, geo-crowdsourcing, often known as volunteered geographic information, has provided an interesting alternative to traditional mapping practices which are becoming expensive, resource-intensive and unable to capture the dynamic nature of urban environments. In order to address a gap in research literature, this paper deals with a survey conducted to assess the current state of geo-crowdsourcing, a recent phenomenon popular with people who collect geographic information using their smartphones. This article points out that there is an increasing body of knowledge of geo-crowdsourcing mobile applications in the Visegrad countries marked by the ubiquitous Internet connection and the current massive proliferation of smartphones. This article shows how geo-crowdsourcing can be used as a complement, or in some cases a replacement, to traditionally generated sources of spatial data and information in public management. It discusses the new spaces of citizen participation constructed by these geo-crowdsourcing practices.","- Citizen participation

NO,Improving Data Quality in Citizen Science Apps for Conservation Biology,"Field data collection by Citizen Scientists has been hugely assisted by the rapid development and spread of smart phones as well as apps that make use of the integrated technologies contained in these devices. We can improve the quality of the data by increasing utilisation of the device in-built sensors and improving the software user-interface. Improvements to data timeliness can be made by integrating directly with national and international biodiversity repositories, such as the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA).

I will present two Citizen Science apps that we developed for the conservation of two of Australia's iconic species – the koala and the echidna. First is the Koala Counter app used in the Great Koala Count 2 – a two-day Blitz-style population census. The aim was to improve both the recording of citizen science effort as well as to improve the recording of ""absence"" data which would improve population modelling. Our solution was to increase the transparent use of the phone sensors as well as providing an easy-to-use user interface. Second is the EchidnaCSI app – an observational tool for collecting sightings and samples of echidna.

From a software developer's perspective, I will provide details on multi-platform app development as well as collaboration and integration with the Australian national biodiversity repository – the Atlas of Living Australia. Preliminary analysis regarding data quality will be presented along with lessons learned and paths for future research. I also seek feedback and further ideas on possible enhancements or modifications that might usefully be made to improve these techniques.","- citizen science

NO,Improving Data Quality in eBird- the Expert Reviewer Network,"eBird is a global citizen science project that gathers observations of birds. The project has been making a considerable contribution to the collection and sharing of bird observations, even in the data-poorest countries, and is accelerating the accumulation of bird records globally. On 22 March 2018 eBird surpassed ½ billion bird observations.

A primary component of ensuring the best quality data is the network of more than 1300 volunteer reviewers who scour incoming data for accuracy. Reviewers provide active feedback to participants on everything from bird identification to best practices for data collection. Since eBird's inception in 2002, almost 23 million observations have been reviewed, requiring more than 190,000 hours of effort by reviewers. In this presentation we review how eBird recruits expert reviewers, describe their responsibilities, and offer some insight in new developments to improve the reviewing process.

How are reviewers recruited. There are three primary methods that used to identify new reviewers. First, if we don't have any active participants in a region (e.g., Kamchatka Russia) eBird staff search birding listserves to find an individual who is reporting a lot of high-quality observations from the area. We then contact those individuals and offer them the opportunity to review records for the region. This option has the lowest likelihood of success. Second, if an individual is submitting a lot of records to eBird from a region that needs a reviewer we contact them and request their participation. Third, in much of the world eBird has partner groups. These partner organizations (e.g., Taiwan, Spain, India, Portugal, Australia, and all of the Western Hemisphere) recruit their own reviewers. The third method is the most effective way to gain expert participation.

What does a reviewer do? eBird reviewers work to improve eBird data in three primary areas. First, they develop and manage the eBird checklist filters for a region. These filters generate a checklist of birds for a particular time and location, and determine what records get flagged for further review. Second, if an eBird participant tries to report a species that is not on the checklist, or if the number of individuals of a species exceeds the filter limit, then these records get flagged for review. Reviewers contact the observer and request further documentation. Currently, 57% of all records that are evaluated by reviewers are validated. Finally, eBird reviewers validate whether the participant is eBirding correctly. That is, are they correctly filling out the information on when, where, and how they went birding. It has been our experience that different types of reviewers are required to effectively review eBird submissions: those who are good at reviewing bird records and those who are good at educating observers on how to participate.

What are future plans? eBird will move towards more effective reviewer teams, where the volume of observations can be split amongst a number of individuals with different strengths, allowing identification experts to focus on observation-level ID issues; and strong communicators to focus on working with contributors on checklist-level best practices. Currently, a single eBird review platform handles a broad array of different reviewing functions. It is our intent to split some of these functions into multiple platforms. For example, right now all review happens at the database level of the 'observation': a record of a taxon at a date and location. Plans are underway to develop tools that will allow reviewers to work at the entire checklist level (i.e., to more easily review the accuracy of how all the observations during a checklist event were submitted), which will enable much more effective review of checklist-level data quality concerns.","- eBird

NO,In Pursuit of the Voices within Social Design Discourse,"Design has expanded its scope towards social change and innovation– this is observed to a great extent in the UK in parallel with \""The Big Society\"" , but is happening globally as well. The existing literature concentrates on practices, approaches and outcomes, with a desire to understand the implementation and the impact of these social 'design interventions'. Consequently, what is informing or may inform this practice seems less evident. This paper aims to raise awareness towards the presuppositions in design practice and research, and proposes the application of Foucauldian discourse theory to uncover and challenge any presuppositions for a more legitimate conduct. The underlying research forms part of a doctoral study that seeks to examine the role of design in society and aims to accommodate the ongoing discussions around the agency of design. The work-in-progress involves an investigation of the three parts of \""social design dispositive\"" , based on Jäger and Maier's (2016) framework, to not only open up new debates in academic design research, but also to provide design practitioners a way to reflect on their work, and ultimately to inform their decision-making process by reinforcing their theoretical foundations.","- Design for Social Innovation

NO,iNaturalist is an Unexploited Source of Plant-Insect Interaction Data,"The aim of this study was to assess whether it is possible to extract useful interaction data between flowers and visiting insects using photographs from citizen science. Ultimately the longer-term aim is to understand possible impacts of invasive species on pollination networks.

We used data from iNaturalist (https://www.inaturalist.org), GBIF (https://www.gbif.org), and GLOBI (https://www.globalbioticinteractions.org). From iNaturalist, we used photographs to extract flower visitation interactions. GBIF data were used for plant and pollinator occurrences, and GLOBI was used for information about known interactions between plants and pollinators. For this study we selected four plant species: Oxalis pes-caprae (Bermuda buttercup), Cirsium vulgare (spear thistle) Amorpha fruticosa (false indigo) and Lantana camara (common lantana). These species are relatively common, frequently photographed and known to be attractive to insects. All of these species are also considered invasive in different parts of world.

We found that over 60% of all photographs identified as a picture of a bee (Apoidea) also showed a flower that the insect was visiting. Thirty-nine percent of butterflies (Papilionoidea) were photographed on a flower and 38% of Syrphidae. Currently, there are about 170,000 pictures of bees; 700,000 butterflies and 50,000 Syrphidae on iNaturalist from all over the world. This means there is a vast untapped resource of insect-plant interaction data on iNaturalist just waiting for exploitation.

iNaturalist provides a standardized and cost-efficient enhancement to specimen collection, and it can be easily adapted for specific research goals. However, the relatively high rate of photographs without both species identifications (plant and visitor) highlights the importance of investing in resources to promote this approach and the importance of determining the identity of all species in a photograph.","- Citizen science

NO,Incentives for Crowdsourcing,"This whitepaper provides an overview perspective on the foundation of crowdsourcing and crowdsensing, detailing related notions such as collective intelligence and citizen science. As all crowd-based initiatives are usually built upon a core of volunteers participating to an “open call” to perform tasks, crowdsensing in particular relies on the willingness of participants to invest time and interest in a cause, sacrifice limited resources of their mobile devices, and provide implicit or explicit efforts, including ignoring risks that impact the privacy of their data. This document describes how incentives and rewarding schemes are adopted in this context to attract a community of users and to keep it engaged. Two incentive schemes in particular are described, both of which have been developed within the CROWD4ROADS project: a game mode that transforms collected data into generated terrain for a 2D platform game and a voucher exchange system that acts as a platform for any initiative for the common good. Both incentive schemes are fully anonymous and integrate within a fully anonymous data collection scheme.","- CROWD4ROADS

NO,Increasing understanding of alien species through citizen science (Alien-CSI),"There is no sign of saturation in accumulation of alien species (AS) introductions worldwide, additionally the rate of spread for some species has also been shown to be increasing. However, the challenges of gathering information on AS are recognized. Recent developments in citizen science (CS) provide an opportunity to improve data flow and knowledge on AS while ensuring effective and high quality societal engagement with the issue of IAS (Invasive Alien Species). Advances in technology, particularly on-line recording and smartphone apps, along with the development of social media, have revolutionized CS and increased connectivity while new and innovative analysis techniques are emerging to ensure appropriate management, visualization, interpretation and use and sharing of the data. In early July 2018 we launched a European CO-operation in Science and Technology (COST) Action to address multidisciplinary research questions in relation to developing and implementing CS, advancing scientific understanding of AS dynamics while informing decision-making specifically implementation of technical requirements of relevant legislation such as the EU Regulation 1143/2014 on IAS. It will also support the EU biodiversity goals and embedding science within society. The Action will explore and document approaches to establishing a European-wide CS AS network. It will embrace relevant innovations for data gathering and reporting to support the implementation of monitoring and surveillance measures, while ensuring benefits for society and citizens, through an AS CS European network. The Action will, therefore, increase levels of participation and quality of engagement with current CS initiatives, ensuring and evaluating educational value, and improve the value outcomes for potential users including citizens, scientists, alien species managers, policy-makers, local authorities, industry and other stakeholders.","- public participation in science

NO,INFORME DEL OBSERVATORIO DE LA CIENCIA CIUDADANA EN ESPAÑA,"Citizen science refers to the participation of the general public in scientific research activities in which citizens actively contribute, either with their intellectual effort or with the knowledge of their environment or providing their own tools and resources. Volunteer participants provide experimental data conforming new tools for researchers, they raise new questions and co-create a new scientific culture. While citizens add value to researchers, they acquire new skills and a deeper understanding of scientific work in an appealing and direct way. As a result of this open, networked and transdisciplinary scenario, science-society-policy interactions are improved, leveraging more democratic research based on evidence and informed decision-making. These results of the open engagement must also be understood in terms of technological innovation, social inclusion and optimization of resources, with a great potential for scientific excellence using larger data sources and collective intelligence. In summary, the collective creativity and the potential of scientific innovation are enriched by the greater number and variety of collaborators and the values of responsible research are adopted.

 

Citizen science is growing in number of experiments, in range of themes and increasingly nature of participants. Spain occupies a prominent place in Europe and in the world in the ranking of publications as well as international projects and initiatives. This document presents a report on the activities of promotion and analysis of citizen science in our country, seeking to increase our knowledge and vision on citizen science. It seeks to lay the foundations of a long-term work to first understand how citizen science is changing the relationship between science and society, and secondly provoking change thanks to the inclusion of new actors and new practices of open participation . In other words, the project seeks to understand the impact of Citizen Science on Spanish scientific culture. To achieve this, the Observatory has identified a significant number of actors (research groups, funding programs, citizens' initiatives, physical spaces, NGOs ...),  it has analyzed major trends and best practices, and collected tools for long term monitoring of citizen science in Spain.

We can summarize that Spain has a growing number of projects and actors listed as citizen science. This number is higher than what we find in most European countries. Its impacts are both scientific, social and educational. The use of citizen science and its study is found in publications, with an increasing evolution around several disciplines, especially biodiversity and environmental monitoring. But the impact of science is also noticeable in practice outside academia, including social networks.

 

The Observatory of Citizen Science in Spain has served to promote and foster coordination between citizen science in our country. We have developed face-to-face events with more than 100 cases between workshops and presentations, including citizen scientists. Also online activities have been developed to work with and to disseminate citizen science.","- citizen science, ciencia ciudadana",publication,Project deliverable,deliverable,2016-12-31,,706604,10.5281/zenodo.225678,225678,"- Fermin Serrano

NO,Institutional mapping of open educational practices beyond use of Open Educational Resources,"Many initiatives exist to increase the adoption of open educational practices (OEP) within universities, but few initiatives start by exploring the capacity of educators to adopt open approaches. This paper addresses this challenge, suggesting that in order to build OEP capacity, universities should build on the existing skills of local champions who are familiar with open approaches. The paper builds on the Open Educators’ Factory methodology to map the capacities of university teachers across four areas: open design, open content, open teaching and open assessment and presents the results of its application to a case study within an Italian university. The pilot demonstrates that by using this approach, it is possible to map universities’ existing OEP and connect them with the capability of local educators. This enables university managers to build on the expertise of open education practitioners to raise the overall capacity of their staff to adopt open approaches.",,publication,Journal article,article,2018-12-03,,2628372,10.1080/01587919.2018.1520040,2628373,"- Nascimbeni, Fabio

NO,Integrating multiple sources of biodiversity information greatly expands the range of a rare species of Hymenoptera (Vanhorniidae),"Vanhornia eucnemidarum Crawford is the only species of Vanhorniidae that occurs in North America. This species is rarely collected and thus the distribution is not well documented. Intending to uncover a more accurate range of this species, we assembled collection records from museums, personal collections and citizen science projects. Many of these records were non-digitised and had to be personally requested.

Here we expand the known distribution of V. eucnemidarum to include nine new provinces and states: Manitoba, Connecticut, Oregon, Mississippi, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Texas and Wisconsin. Although Quebec has been listed as a previous locality, the recorded province was mislabelled, so Quebec is now also officially a provincial record.","- Animalia

NO,Interactions between the communities of Les Herbonautes and Die Herbonauten: Observation notes,"Citizen sciences are taking a growing part in transcribing natural history scientific collections. Opening digitized labels to the general public is not only to complement data produced institutionally, it allows to highlight the collections and their use for science and biodiversity.


Designed in 2012 by the Muséum national d’Histoire naturelle, Paris after the mass digitisation of this institution herbarium, Les Herbonautes gathered an active community over its 6 years of existence. The French national infrastructure ReColNat developed a more flexible version and opens the source code to the biodiversity community. Die Herbonauten was launched by the Botanischer Garten und Botanisches Museum Berlin in 2018, based on the French platform code. These two linguistic versions of the herbonauts systems are managed independently one from another, each building its community separately.


During ICEDIG project, a pilot project has been held on several citizen science platform, including Les Herbonautes and Die Herbonauten. On the French as on the German platform, the project was held during summer 2018. The two synchronized missions brought to light some unexpected exchanges between the two user communities.

,"Invasive Siberian chipmunks Eutamias sibiricus in Italy: a socio-ecological analysis indicates that they could, and should, be removed","Eradication of invasive alien species is a form of pest control linked to biodiversity conservation that usually involves killing animals. Squirrels are prominent among invasive alien species in Italy with four species introduced. Three of them are included within the list of alien species of European concern and their eradication and control is recommended. However, their local control is not an easy task, being highly appreciated by the general public. We
propose a socio-ecological approach to evaluate the feasibility of eradicating Siberian chipmunks (Eutamias sibiricus) populations. We performed a structured questionnaire to assess the social perception of invasive Siberian chipmunks in urban parks where they occur and to identify groups of visitors who might oppose eradication. We also carried out geographic profiling to test for the spatial expansion of chipmunk populations. Overall, park visitors regarded chipmunks positively and appreciated to see them, but human-chipmunk interactions were still rare. We did not identify any group of visitors with a strong attachment to chipmunks, who might oppose future control programs. Geographic profiling showed that chipmunks in Valeggio sul Mincio are starting to expand outside of their introduction site. Data from questionnaires show that chipmunks eradication, coupled with adequate communication initiatives, might be feasible. Moreover, geographic profiling indicates that time for a rapid removal is running out. Socio-ecological approaches, combining the analysis of structured questionnaires administered to stakeholders and statistical modeling of pest observations, could be a valuable tool to decide the feasibility and the urgency of invasive pest control.",,other,Other,,2019-01-30,10.5281/zenodo.2553167,2553167,10.5281/zenodo.2556592,2556592,"- Jacopo Cerri

La subcuenca del río Cotón cuenta con amenazas y oportunidades de conservación, las cuales deben ser abordadas a través de su ordenamiento territorial, entendido esto como un espacio de construcción social en torno a la sostenibilidad ambiental. Para el ordenamiento de este territorio, debemos conocer la riqueza biológica y ecosistémica, como línea base para establecer y ejecutar un plan de manejo y ordenamiento de la subcuenca del río Cotón. Aquí presentamos la primera fase de la caracterización biológica de la subcuenca del río Cotón, en la que se realizó un trabajo de campo para obtener un inventario preliminar de anfibios, reptiles, peces, aves y mamíferos. Este inventario fue complementado con la revisión y organización de fuentes de información secundaria, así como un análisis con Sistemas de Información Geográfica (SIG). Para la subcuenca del río Cotón, encontramos 53 especies de anfibios, de las cuales 15 se encuentran en alguna categoría de amenaza (Vulnerable, En Peligro y Peligro Crítico según la IUCN) y por lo tanto tienen importancia para la conservación. Para reptiles registramos 30 especies, de las cuales Geophis talamancae es la única amenazada (En Peligro), pero otras 5 especies tienen distribución restringida a Costa Rica y Panamá. Para Aves se recopilaron 205 especies, de las cuales 5 son de importancia para conservación por encontrarse en categoría de Vulnerable. En cuanto a mamíferos se han registrado 41 especies, de las cuales 6 se encuentran en alguna categoría de amenaza. Para peces pocas especies se ha evaluado su riesgo de extinción, pero algunas de ellas están restringidas a la zona pacífico sur de Costa Rica o a Panamá y Costa Rica, por lo tanto son importantes para conservar. La riqueza biológica representativa de esta subcuenca cuenta con especies amenazadas, endémicas e irremplazables, que hacen de la subcuenca del río Cotón, un importante área para la conservación de la biodiversidad en Costa Rica. Amenazas como la pérdida y degradación de hábitat, la cacería, contaminación y potenciales proyectos hidroeléctricos, pueden poner en peligro la supervivencia de las poblaciones de las especies que habitan la subcuenca y que son de interés para conservación. Teniendo en cuenta que la economía de esta zona está basada en la agricultura y es una zona de alto potencial turístico, debe darse prioridad al desarrollo en estos sectores de manera sostenible, de manera que se mitigue o elimine la deforestación, contaminación y cacería, y se eviten proyectos de infraestructura energética que modifiquen las condiciones ecológicas de la subcuenca.","- biodiversity

S’ha convidat als participants a decidir quin preu estan disposats a pagar per llogar un habitatge, invertint una moneda virtual equivalent a la renda neta per capita mitjana de cada municipi i un preu de sortida del lloguer fixat mitjançant l’índex del preu de lloguer oficial a cada indret. El fet de variar aquests valors en cada municipi fa que els resultats de la recerca tinguin una lectura diferent per a cada municipi doncs atenen a la inquietud sobre l’accés a l’habitatge tenint en compte el context local. No obstant, és igualment cert que el fet de respondre a la mateixa inquietud de forma coordinada aporta un major valor a la recerca científica realitzada tant en el seu conjunt com en cada municipi doncs la comparativa entre municipis pot facilitar un millor interpretació dels resultats.

NO,Joint Statement on new opportunities for air quality sensing - lower-cost sensors for public authorities and citizen science initiatives,"Low-cost air quality sensors continue to spread. While their measurement quality does not compete with high-end instrumentation deployed in official air quality monitoring stations, they have a great potential to complement existing air quality assessments. However, we still see challenges related to data quality, data interoperability, and for collaborating on data assimilation and calibration. In order to move ahead we gathered as a group of 38 organisations from 14 different countries, including governmental authorities, network operators, citizen science initiatives, environmental Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs), and academic researchers to explore how we can collaborate and better leverage each other's work. This statement captures our joint findings and recommendations.

Our key observations include:

Co-operation between official monitoring networks (reference quality data) and lower-cost sensor operators is a key to make air quality data more usable. To be able to combine forces and benefit from each other's expertise, the different perspectives of all stakeholders should be taken into account. There is a need to ensure that all users understand the possibilities and the limitations of making sense out of observations from different sensors. It is not realistic to expect that in the near future the data quality of lower-cost sensors will be as good as that of the official data. A way to make use of data that is of lower accuracy is by employing them in air quality modelling. Transparency about data quality is important to build more trust in the data, and to avoid unrealistic expectations. The need for interoperability should be clearly articulated and promoted by potential data users. There a need (and an opportunity) to provide guidance and standard operating procedures for the deployment and calibration of lower-cost sensors in order to increase the data quality delivered by participants of citizen science projects. Presently, we prefer to consider fixed-stationary sensors in a network instead of mobile sensor data. Furthermore, stationary data should not be aggregated with data from mobile sensors. Publishing and sharing this statement is only small step in the right direction and further actions have to be taken, inlcuding more in-depth discussions of the recommendations in smaller groups and follow-up meetings on dedicated topics.","- air quality

NO,Layers of complexity: the importance of realism in neural network classifications of interacting galaxies,"Visual classification is hard. It is time-consuming and ultimately subjective. Fortunately, there are solutions to these problems in the form of citizen science projects and machine learning methods. But far more challenging is identification and classification of interacting systems. When armed only with photometry, contaminants such as field stars and unfortuitously projected galaxies often lead to misclassifications (dependence on environment). Similarly, the classifcations rely sensitively on the identification of low-surface brightness features such as tidal arms, streams, and shells (dependence on sky brightness and resolution). Simulations, on the other hand, offer foreknowledge of the stage of an interaction. Using a suite of 24 galaxy interactions covering a range of mass ratios and orbits with corresponding secular evolution runs, we train convolutional neural networks to classify galaxies into three categories: (iso) isolated; (p/i) pair/interacting; and (pm) post-merger. Our networks are trained on images with increasing levels of realism: (0) projected stellar mass maps; (1) full radiative transfer; (2) insertion into real images. We are then well-poised to answer unique questions. How important is the level of realism to the successful classification of interacting systems? How important is it to train the network with contaminating effects (inserting into real images) so that the network may adequately discriminate between bona-fide interactions and false positives? In this talk, I will discuss our answers to these questions.",,presentation,Presentation,,2019-04-10,10.5281/zenodo.2635338,2635338,10.5281/zenodo.2635339,2635339,"- Bottrell, Connor

NO,LIBER Open Science Roadmap,"Embracing Open Science is critical if we are to make science more collaborative, reproducible, transparent and impactful. Open Science undoubtedly has the power to positively influence society, but its implementation is not yet universal.

A revolution is required: one which opens up research processes and changes mindsets in favour of a world where policies, tools and infrastructures universally support the growth and sharing of knowledge.

Research libraries are well placed to make that revolution happen, and LIBER's Open Science Roadmap outlines the specific actions libraries can take to champion Open Science, both within and beyond their own institutions.

As we explain in detail throughout this document, libraries need to advocate for Open Science locally and internationally, to support Open Science through tools and services and to expand the impact of their work through collaboration and partnerships. LIBER has shaped its 2018-2022 Strategy to support and enable Open Science and it is our hope that this Roadmap will help Europe’s research libraries to do the same.

This document was written during spring 2018, when the Open Science Policy Platform (OSPP) produced integrated advice for the EC and key stakeholders.

NO,LinBi: Linking biodiversity and culture information,"The LinBi project aims to enhance the discoverability of digitized objects from natural history collections hosted by institutes all over Europe. This enhancement is achieved by publishing new and enriched content to the Europeana collections platform. The use of simple vocabularies and machine-readable metadata encourages reuse and has the additional advantage of facilitating the clustering of interesting content for user groups beyond biodiversity and natural history researchers. Linking the collections of Europe together in an openly-available platform and sharing our common cultural and natural heritage with a broad audience will increase the public's awareness of biodiversity collections. Furthermore, it will help us reach out to new user groups such as teachers, journalists and artists, who were previously unaware of, or distant from, our collections.

Suitable content was selected and harmonized for interlinking with Europeana. Contributions include a large quantity of herbarium sheets, digitized glass plate negatives taken between 1880 and 1930 and a portrait collection dating from the late 19th and early 20th century. With the help of the DoeDat crowdsourcing platform, existing metadata were enriched and mobilized to allow for publication in the form of open linked data.

The integration of geographical data and common names allows the Europeana platform to link scientific specimens with literature and fine art from different collections and to guide users to interesting and inspiring content via themed virtual exhibitions. One such theme is composed of content from the ""Wild Roses of Crépin"" collection, which will be enriched by pictures of living plants, herbarium specimens and illustrations old and modern. A second content cluster consists of an enriched and curated collection of botanical illustrations originating from a corpus of special and rare books ranging from the 15th to 19th centuries.

NO,Looking for city 4.0. Two work in progress experiences in Zaragoza,"This study presents the current status of two work-in-progress experiments of citizen’s participation in the design and self-definition of the resilient city developed in the Open Urban Lab of eTOPIA art and technology centre and in the Harinera communitarian art centre in Zaragoza (Spain). Both pilot projects are part of a main framework of research about the potential role of Informatics and communication technologies, citizen science experiment, self-fabrication and maker's tools in the citizen's participation to the resilient city. The goal of the investigation is to define a method of co-create and bottom up environmental analysis for a self determination of a resilient urban productive landscape.

Moving from a definition of City 4.0 the investigation will focus on is on citizen's role in the bottom up revolution from smart city to resilient city. Finally it will be presented how the use of open technologies and co-design techniques are going to be involved in two pilot projects: La Milla Productiva mapping of the Digital Mile Park for a resilient landscape design; and Guerrilla Energética an artistic, low tech actions to transform wasted urban areas by means of workshops of self-defined energy productive landscapes.","- citizen science

Behavioral science can be accelerated greatly by the use of digitally controlled devices capable
of measuring relevant parameters and, if necessary, interact with the experiment. Those
machines can be bought and they can do things in an implemented way. They are however
neither cheap nor as adaptive as they should be. The focus of this poster is to demonstrate
how to overcome the rather small barriers in order to develop their own machines. Recently,
open hardware projects like the Arduino or the Raspberry Pi draw enormous community
coding and building elements that can be fused together to fit the experimenters needs. We as
scientists can benefit from large numbers of projects that are documented well in the internet,
mostly by tutorial videos including component lists and code. Here we present a number of
simple suggestions how to build yourself helpful devices for your behavioral and
neurophysiological experiments.

Cheap smart meter design are designed not only to measure and monitoring power generation but also to enable and support new operation and control functions in power generation. In addition, this meter facilitates the user to read the energy meter even when the user is far away from the appliance. The purposed method consist of hardware and software parts. With the availability of internet access the energy data can be read quickly and easily through user’s smartphone without using any wires to PC or remote devices. It is based on open source hardware ie ESP-12E and ACS712. This smart meter uses ACS 721 current sensor to detect the current. NodeMCU take most important data such as voltage, current, and active power so that all further calculations can be made by the center of the system. Smart meter can be used as a metering energy or as a quality meter power to provide the user with the ability to monitor the power value as well as current value.

It is commonly seen as a bottom-up, grass root approach to technology, and therefore sometimes associated with an aura of rebellion and democratizing decentralization. Yet, most of our products are not produced by highly sophisticated robots, but by people working hands-on, hacking away under quite harmful conditions, yet with ridiculously small income. And because they don’t own the patent of what they are manufacturing, those who do own the patent get the main portion of the money we pay for these products. Nevertheless, communities who still share skills on how to produce, manufacture, hack and repair things, even if out of necessity, enjoy a certain form of autonomy and seem to have the longer breath. Communities who hack, come up with new ideas they want to tell others, voluntarily or involuntarily they collaborate and mingle.

NO,MammalWeb – Participant guided development of a generalised citizen science web platform,"Talk presented at the 101st annual meeting of the Ecological Society of America in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, United States.

Date/time: 14:30, 8 August 2016

Session: COS 7 - Education and Outreach I talk 4; room 220/221, Ft Lauderdale Convention Center

Camera trap ecology can be viewed as the combination of three steps: data collection, data processing (photo classification), and data analyses. Careful application of these steps can yield valuable insights into ecological parameters. There have been highly successful citizen science projects which crowdsourced at least one of the first two steps, saving substantial time and resources for researchers. However, we believe there is potential to take citizen science camera trapping from “citizens as sensors” to having active participants in all phases of research, which could benefit both researchers and citizen scientists. To that end, we implemented our pilot project – MammalWeb – to integrate all three phases of camera trapping into a complete citizen science web platform. Through a partnership between Durham University and the Durham Wildlife Trust, we recruited citizen scientists from the public to deploy and monitor camera traps across the north east of England. They were trained in camera trapping methodology and asked to employ the same sampling protocol. To integrate camera trap ecology into education, computer science students at Durham University help develop the backend technology for MammalWeb, and secondary school students are leading multidisciplinary projects with teachers to create outreach material for ecological curricula and the public.
As of February 2016, over 50 citizen scientists are monitoring camera traps at more than 130 sites across northeast England. They have uploaded over 43,000 images to MammalWeb, of which more than 28,000 have been classified by more than 100 registered users. An algorithm adapted from past work was developed by computer science students at Durham University to calculate consensus identifications of animals from the crowdsourced data, on which a user-facing dashboard is being created for participants to explore and interrogate the database. Our collaboration with secondary schools has engaged students in becoming seed ecological ambassadors, and created multimedia projects to share ecological knowledge with their communities.
In this talk, I will describe:

The MammalWeb user experience 
 
How our collaboration with educational institutions has produced actively involved citizen scientists in camera trap monitoring, and
 
How participants help develop MammalWeb into a modular and generalisable citizen science web platform for big data ecology. This platform can then be deployed by other organisations to crowdsource their research. Lastly, I will report key challenges faced by this approach, plus the potential for future work on integrating state of the art technology into citizen science ecology.","- citizen science

NO,Managing a Mass Digitization Project at Meise Botanic Garden: From Start to Finish,"Mass digitization is a large undertaking for a collection. It is disruptive of routine and can challenge long-held practises. Having been through the procedure and survived, we feel we have a lot of experience to share with other institutions who are considering taking on this challenge. The changes that digitization has made to our institution are positive and the digitization a success, but that is not to say that we would not have done some things differently, were we to repeat the exercise.

In 2015 Meise Botanic Garden received a grant from the Flemish Government to upgrade its digitization infrastructure and mass digitize 1.2 million specimens from its African and Belgian Herbaria. The new infrastructure improved our workflow significantly, enabling us to digitize specimens five to ten times faster while also improving their quality.

The mass digitization part of the project was split into two parts, imaging and transcription. The contract was awarded and out-sourced to Picturae, who started imaging in May 2016 using a conveyor belt installation. Prior to starting, a significant amount of preparation was required at the herbarium. Within one year, 1.2 million specimens were imaged. The images were captured as TIFF files and stored in triplicate at The Flemish Institute for Archiving (VIAA), while smaller derived JPEG 2000 and JPEG files were generated for day-to-day use.

The second part of the project was label transcription. A third of the specimens were transcribed in-house for capturing minimal data (barcode, filing name, collector, collector number & country of origin). This was partly done to reduce costs, but also allowed us to compare in-house to out-sourced transcription. Some 500,000 specimens were transcribed, either completely or partially, by Alembo (subcontracted by Picturae).The remaining 200.000 specimens from our Belgian Herbarium are being transcribed using crowdsourcing. The latter is being realized through the citizen science platform DoeDat (www.doedat.be) that was launched in November 2017.

Many lessons have been learnt with respect to implementing mass digitization, both practically and sociologically. Many of the problems encountered during the project could have been avoided by changing the workflow. The addition of extra control points during the process could have reduced problems encountered later in the data capture process. Solving these problems at a later stage was time consuming. Trying to ""save money"" can result in a disruptive workflow, which may lead to a number of costly errors. Mass digitization has fundamentally changed the workflow in our collections and the way in which our herbarium is managed. All images for the African and Belgian collections may be now found on our new virtual herbarium www.botanicalcollections.be.","- Mass Digitization

The overarching objective of SSNet is to advance knowledge on the role of small streams in water quality, biodiversity and ecosystem services protection that will inform policy, measures and management options to meet water quality and other resources protection targets. The project will start with a synthesis of available information on the importance of small streams to initiate communication with stakeholders and introduce the project. This will be followed by a compilation and analysis of existing data on small streams in Ireland to inform the selection of sites for the proposed research. Three work packages will collect new data on hydrochemistry with a focus on the nutrient retention potential of headwater streams, hydromorphology and biodiversity. All three investigations will share common sites to enable interconnections between the three elements to be explored and provide an integrated approach to the research. Modelling based on the results from each of the aforementioned tasks will be used to estimate the level of intervention in the small stream network required to have measurable effects throughout a catchment on both water quality (N, P & sediment) and flows, and overall delivery/maintenance of ecosystem services. We will also engage volunteers in both biological water quality and hydromorphological assessments and evaluate the potential of citizen science in facilitating greater monitoring coverage of the small stream network.","- Small stream network

NO,"Methods, New Software Tools, and Best Practices for Developing High-quality Training Data for Machine Learning-based Image Analysis in Biodiversity Research","Recent progress in using deep learning techniques to automate the analysis of complex image data is opening up exciting new avenues for research in biodiversity science. However, potential applications of machine learning methods in biodiversity research are often limited by the relative scarcity of data suitable for training machine learning models. Development of high-quality training data sets can be a surprisingly challenging task that can easily consume hundreds of person-hours of time. In this talk, we present the results of our recent work implementing and comparing several different methods for generating annotated, biodiversity-oriented image data for training machine learning models, including collaborative expert scoring, local volunteer image annotators with on-site training, and distributed, remote image annotation via citizen science platforms. We discuss error rates, among-annotator variance, and depth of coverage required to ensure highly reliable image annotations. We also discuss time considerations and efficiency of the various methods. Finally, we present new software, called ImageAnt (currently under development), that supports efficient, highly flexible image annotation workflows. ImageAnt was created primarily in response to the challenges we discovered in our own efforts to generate image-based training data for machine learning models. ImageAnt features a simple user interface and can be used to implement sophisticated, adaptive scripting of image annotation tasks.","- machine learning

Project:

Brain atlases parcellate the brain into discrete regions, which form organizational units in many computational models. Many brain atlases are derived from high resolution MR images, but to get access to the cellular organization (cytoarchitecture) of the tissue, atlases based on high resolution microscopy sections are needed. Until now, the complexity and data requirements of the atlas creation process have restricted it to the confounds of specialized laboratories. Here we present an online platform to accelerate this process by allowing it to be done publicly and collaboratively, in a web-based environment.

NO,Monitoring and management of Cerambyx cerdo in the Mediterranean region – a review and the potential role of citizen science,"The Great Capricorn beetle, Cerambyx cerdo, and Mediterranean oak habitats (Quercus ilex – 9340 and Quercus suber – 9330) are protected by the Habitats Directive (HD). However, in the Mediterranean basin, these habitats are also traditionally used for animal, wood, and cork productions. Cerambyx cerdo feeds into the wood of trees and can be perceived by forest practitioners as an umbrella species or as a pest, depending on the context. Monitoring programmes involving forest practitioners could thus focus on assessing: 1) the conservation status of the Great Capricorn beetle and habitats (distribution and abundance of insects and reproductive sites or colonised trees), 2) pest status, and 3) management options to achieve both conservational and economic benefits. Considering that Cerambyx cerdo and Cork and Holm oak forests are not priority species or habitats under the HD, targeted funding is likely to be limited for monitoring. In this context, citizen science could gather important information on the target species useful for the monitoring programmes and management. To address management questions, the citizen science based programme for Cerambyx cerdo monitoring and habitat conservation should be seen not only as citizens collecting good data sets, but also as a deeper collaboration amongst different knowledge bodies and perspectives within a community – based environmental monitoring and learning network.","- Animalia

Concerning saproxylic beetles, seven species present in its territory have to be monitored: Lucanus cervus, Cerambyx cerdo, Morimus funereus, Rhysodes sulcatus, Cucujus cinnaberinus, Rosalia alpina and Osmoderma eremita complex. Out of these species, a monitoring programme has only been established for Lucanus cervus, which partially includes participation of non-experts. In 2015 and 2016, a public campaign was organised in order to collect observations of Lucanus cervus and two other saproxylic beetles that are easily recognisable by the public: Morimus funereus and Rosalia alpina. Data gathered through this campaign serve as an addition to the mapping activities and monitoring of the species' range. So far, more than 650 citizen observations have been collected, providing data on species presence in 216 10×10 km2 grid cells intended for reporting on the species' range. Besides the public campaign, since 2014, public institutions for managing nature protected values have been involved in population monitoring for which they received education through several workshops. Altogether, 21 sites have been included in the monitoring of the stag beetle so far. Data collected for Lucanus cervus on standard transects, by tree and ground pitfall traps and tree trunk surveys at night will be discussed. To the present time, eight public institutions have been involved in stag beetle population monitoring and the number has been continuously increasing.","- citizen science data (CSD)

,Motivating Citizen Scientists to Dive with Sharks," 

 

How do you get citizen scientists to dive with sharks?  

 

 

Given the current level of Galeophobia, or fear of sharks, that's an excellent question. Most people will leave the water immediately if they think a shark is in the area. Oddly, the greatest number of those who fear sharks seem to come from those who rarely, if ever, go into the ocean—so, clearly, this is a primal fear, much like snakes or spiders.

 

Enter: the average scuba diver. Our experience at Ocean Sanctuaries suggests that many (but not all) divers have great respect for these apex predators and—ready for this? —Can't wait to dive with them. They engender such awe and fear, that merely being in the vicinity of a shark is an adrenaline rush for many divers,  to say nothing of the 'fish tales' which will be told later.

 

But, what about collecting scientific data on sharks? Again, our experience has been that there is a sub- group of 'self-selecting,' highly motivated divers, who are eager to get close enough to a shark to photograph it. In fact, they don't need to be asked twice.","- citizen science, sharks, data collection",other,Other,,2019-01-15,,1419341,10.13140/RG.2.2.28862.95042,1419342,- Michael Bear,eng

NO,Notes of Life: A platform for recording species observations driven by artificial intelligence,"Biodiversity research is stepping into a big data era with the rapid increase in the abundance of biodiversity data, especially the large number of species images. It has been a new trend and hot topic on how to utilize artificial intelligence to mine big biodiversity data to support wildlife observation and recognition. In this research, we integrate large numbers of species images, including higher plants, birds and insects, and use a state-of-the-art image deep learning technique to train species auto-recognition models. Currently, we get a model that can recognize more than 900 Chinese birds with top 1 accuracy 81% and top 5 accuracy 95% (top n accuracy means the probability that the correct answer presents in top n predicted results), and more models are coming soon. Based on these models, we developed a platform named Notes of Life (NOL, http://nol.especies.cn), which includes a website and a mobile application (app) for assisting biological scientists and citizen scientists to recognize and record wildlife. Users can upload their observation records and images of wildlife through our mobile app while they are investigating in the wild. The website is used for bulk data uploading and management. Species images can be classified by taxon-specific, plug-in recognition models that speed up the process of identification. There is an expert module in NOL where citizen scientists can work interactively with information provided by biological scientists, and post a species image identification request to experts when they cannot recognize the species by themselves or from models. The expert module is for improving the quality of citizen science data, and it is a supplement of the disadvantage of species auto-recognition models. Above all, NOL embraces the idea that scientific research supports citizen science and citizen science gives feedback to science, and of finding a sustainable way to collect increasingly more reliable data for biodiversity research.","- biodiversity data

NO,OCEAN FRONTIERS FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT,"CONTRIBUTING TO THE UNITED NATIONS SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS & THE UNITED NATIONS DECADAL OF OCEAN SCIENCE INITIATIVES.

FRONTIERS IN OCEAN RESEARCH
The Ocean is the cradle of life and the central component making our planet habitable. Being the largest ecosystem supporting life on Earth, it is paramount we maintain and restore its health in a global context. Thus, the Ocean needs to be present on every agenda for the sustainable development of the world’s population, societies and economies. This manifesto advocates for the increased understanding, protection and management of the Ocean to support the health and well-being of present and future generations.

MANAGE OCEAN COMPLEXITY

The Ocean is by far the largest reservoir of heat in the global climate system and exerts a fundamental contribution in regulating global warming over short (decades) and long (millennia) time scales. Human population growth and climate change are major drivers acting on all ecosystems, with the Ocean being no exception. Increasing temperatures at all depths, acidification, sea level rise, loss of biodiversity, migration of species and habitat destruction and degradation are all consequences of these drivers. Hence, it is necessary that cumulative human pressures (e.g. pollution, plastics, maritime traffic, overfishing, aquaculture, eutrophication, seabed mining, introduced species), the interactions of stressors, and their combined effects on Ocean ecosystem composition and function are understood, assessed and sustainably managed to allow the same opportunities from the Ocean for our future generations. A systemic approach for the integrated assessment of the state of marine ecosystems and the resilience to cumulative pressures is key to promoting the responsible use of marine resources without compromising the future of our Ocean and consequently the future of humankind.

We need to understand and assess the complex interactions of marine systems, anthropogenic drivers and the role of global cumulative impacts with regard to the provision of goods and services in a changing environment. A safe and resilient Ocean will provide more food and other societal benefits, including increased employment, without compromising our future.

SECURE COASTAL AREAS

Global mean sea level is expected to rise by the end of this century and will have a direct impact on coastal areas which currently accommodate over 40% of the world’s populations. This coastal population is increasing disproportionally and it is expected that the majority of future megacities will be located on the coast. These are also areas that sustain keystone breeding and nursery habitats for commercial seafood stocks, have important carbon sequestration functions and constitute the major focus for commercial, aesthetic and touristic activities. The future will thus pose several challenges for the management of coastal areas, from the huge increase in anthropogenic pressures to the need for reconversion and adaptation of present day urban infrastructures. Today, we have the opportunity to develop and demonstrate new nature-based and smart eco-engineering solutions for the sustainable development of our marine urban areas, thereby safeguarding our future well-being.

We must create innovative and coordinated solutions for safe, inclusive, smart, resilient and sustainable marine urban spaces. New monitoring, conservation and restoration measures of marine urban spaces should expand the “Blue” component of present day “Grey” cities, to benefit local populations and global Ocean health.

TARGET OCEAN AND HUMAN HEALTH

Oceans can affect human health in many ways through ingestion of pathogenic microbes or algal toxins, or exposure to toxic chemicals such mercury, lead and pesticides that can cause severe illness. Oceans can also provide enormous human and industrial benefits, through the provision of protein, pharmaceuticals, biofuels and more which in turn support jobs and national economies. A healthier Ocean that is better managed could ensure that the benefits from the exploitation of Ocean resources are sustainably and equitably shared. However, we still face significant gaps in our knowledge of the Ocean. We still have not determined how to balance its opportunities while nurturing the health of its ecosystems. Many species in marine ecosystems are not yet described, and their ecological role and associated services not identified. Just as the study of the human microbiome has revolutionized the field of human health, the study of the Ocean microbiome opens up a new field of discoveries and knowledge. Ocean microbiomes and connectivity between ocean regions are major drivers of biogeochemical processes and play an essential but still poorly understood role in the functioning of marine ecosystems. A better understanding of the complex interactions between oceans and human well-being could allow for the better management of marine resources while preserving all the Ocean ecosystem services provided to our societies.

There is a need to achieve global healthy oceans by characterizing major ecosystems and  understanding the functioning and connectivity of local marine ecosystems to: (a) preserve and enhance associated Ocean services such as increased provision of food, discovering new pharmaceutical products, developing renewable sources of energy, improving recreation and transport; (b) maintain and increase all the cultural and aesthetic services provided to future societies.

PROTECT OCEAN COMMONS

Societies and individuals across the globe benefit from the natural and cultural benefits and services provided by the Ocean. The distribution of these “Ocean commons” is changing. The melting Arctic ice cap, reduction of wild seafood provision, emergence of harmful pathogens and parasites, and previously inaccessible Ocean spaces (e.g. the deep sea) now increasingly within human reach, are challenges that need to be addressed by responsible Ocean governance to reduce the potential for conflict at all levels and ensure human well-being. Current knowledge on how to relate and govern Ocean dynamics and associated societal changes is fragmented, and observations of resource distribution and dynamics are scant and insufficiently accessible. We need to advance theory, observations and modelling of the complex global Ocean to forecast, manage and mitigate these changes. New platforms, sensors, methods, holistic approaches (e.g., systems biology, meta-omics, and ecosystem approaches) and novel theoretical frameworks linking evolutionary theory and oceanography as well as marine social sciences and humanities can provide an integrated framework to inform decision making on the governance of the Ocean commons. Empowering Ocean observations (e.g., citizen science framework, robotics, artificial intelligence) and robust science-based thinking at national and international levels will promote diplomacy and wider societal actions to support responsible and sustainability-enhancing Ocean governance.

Better predictions, observations and theory are needed to manage and share the “Ocean commons” in a fair and responsible way under the present global challenges. These will also ensure that the benefits from the exploitation of Ocean resources can be sustainably managed and equitably shared.","- Ocean Research

NO,Open Culture for Education:  How can community labs contribute to democratize knowledge?,"Abstract

Information is power, but how is this power distributed in our society? It is a fact that the distribution of information (the public knowledge) is not equal for all of us. Conventionally, this is called inequality of educational opportunity. Currently, we are living within the impact of such inequality, also with the globalization phenomenon, which has left us inside of a global crisis (the most important capitalist crisis since World War II). Nevertheless, we have the community forces.

NO,Open Data for the Crowd: an Account of Citizen Science at the ETH Library,"This papers gives an account of ETH Library’s combined strategy of implementing an open data policy and making benefit of crowdsourcing for improving metadata. Both activities go hand in hand and promote each other.

ETH Library renders bibliographical metadata and digital copies publicly accessible and reusable, provided this is not opposed by any third-party rights. Open data at ETH Library pursues the following goals:

Open licence: whenever possible, ETH Library makes its data available using the public domain mark or a CC0 licence. If the prequisites for this are not fulfilled, an open a CC license is used.
Transparency: reliable re-use is indicated transparently for each dataset.
Currentness: ETH Library regularly updates variable datasets.
Freedom from discrimination: there are no access restrictions to the data. The data is available to anyone at any time and without registration.
Free download: the data is free to obtain.
Machine readability: ETH Library provides its data in an open and, whenever possible, machine-readable standard format.
Availability: the data is provided via a suitable interface or platform.

ETH Library’s Image Archive was the first unit to provide content for free download in high resolution. This paved the ground for a very successful crowdsourcing campaign during which citizen scientists located places, dated photographs, and identified people and artefacts. This positive experience led to further activities in diffent units. Recently, tools for georeferencing maps and aerial photographs were implemented and enthusiastically taken up by the crowd. The most recent step was offering the opportunity to transcribe archival documents.

Other important conditions for success apart from the open data policy were a conscious community management by social media channels and promoting competition within a gamification approach.",,presentation,Presentation,,2019-06-28,10.5281/zenodo.3259742,3259742,10.5281/zenodo.3259743,3259743,"- Wiederkehr, Stefan",

This study aims at explaining the implication of Open Design Methodology in enhancing the sense of home in the mass housing through studying end-users’ perceptions of housing physical cues. Accordingly, the collected data through a survey of housing physical cues preferences conducted on 116 Iranian students of Universiti Teknologi Malaysia living at least one year in mass housing apartments was analyzed, using Exploratory Factor Analysis and One Sample t-test. The seven extracted factors from Exploratory Factor Analysis were hierarchically classified into three levels using One Sample t-test. In addressing the aim of the study, the results of One Sample t-test shed light on end-users’ perceptions, making it possible to address two different areas of decision making in mass housing namely professional and ordinary. Dealing with abstract, subjective, complicated, and multidimensional physical cues, the first area is far beyond ordinary end users knowledge, profession, and skill; hence the supervisory role of professionals is highly recommended. The second area deals with concrete and tangible physical features, which has the potential to be left open for end-users’ gradually progressive decision making, and according to their evolving and emerging needs.","- Mass Housing

NO,Open Knowledge Maps: a Visual Interface to the World's Scientific Knowledge,"Getting an overview of a research field and being able to identify a set of relevant findings pertaining to one’s information need are prerequisites for research, evidence-based practice and self-directed learning alike. Yet, the tools for exploring and discovering scientific content are often lacking. With traditional, list-based search engines, users have to examine articles and their relationships by hand, which is a time-consuming process.

Open Knowledge Maps is an attempt to transform discovery of scientific knowledge by providing an open, community-driven non-profit system that leverages the digital open science ecosystem. Instead of lists, we propose to use knowledge maps for discovery. Knowledge maps provide an instant overview of a field by showing the main areas of the field at a glance, and papers related to each area. This makes it possible to easily identify useful, pertinent information.

Our goal is to provide a large-scale system of open, interactive and interlinked knowledge maps for every research topic, every field and every discipline. This system will enable people inside and outside of academia to not only get an overview of a field and identify relevant concepts, but also to discover trends, recognize important researchers, and to understand connections between fields.

On our website https://openknowledgemaps.org, users can currently create a knowledge map for a topic of their choice based on either BASE or PubMed. Our software retrieves the 100 most relevant results for a topic and generates a knowledge map based on textual similarity between the records. The map is intended to give users a head start in their literature research.

With this service, we have created a lot of enthusiasm in the community. Our user base has quickly grown: since our launch in May 2016, we have recorded over half a million visits to the site and more than 120,000 maps have been created. Open Knowledge Maps has become an international collaboration with team members, advisors and partners from variety of fields, including research, librarianship, design, software development, citizen science, and the open knowledge and open science movement.

In the future, we want to turn discovery into an open and collaborative process. Most people are currently tackling discovery on their own – and therefore repeat the same process over and over again. By sharing the results of our discoveries, we can save valuable time and build on top of each other’s knowledge; for example, researchers and medical librarians can collaboratively map the newest research on a certain disease and openly share result of their efforts for the benefit of evidence-based practice and patients affected by this disease.

We see research libraries and librarians as central to this vision. The complex collaborative system outlined above cannot be realized without experts on knowledge stewardship and community engagement. Together with the other stakeholders from research and society, including researchers, students, journalists, citizen scientists and many more, we want to create system that enables us to create pathways through science for each other. So that we can all benefit from this unique knowledge.",,presentation,Presentation,,2019-06-27,10.5281/zenodo.3258105,3258105,10.5281/zenodo.3258106,3258106,"- Kraker, Peter

NO,Open Science and Codes of Conduct on Research Integrity,"Abstract

The purpose of this article is to examine the conceptual alignment between the ethical principles of research integrity and open science. Research integrity is represented in this study by four general codes of conduct on responsible conduct of research (RCR), three of them international in scope, and one national. A representative list of ethical principles associated with open science is compiled in order to create categories for assessing the content of the codes. According to the analysis, the current understanding of RCR is too focused on traditional publications and the so called FFP definition of research misconduct to fully support open science. The main gaps include recognising citizen science and societal outreach and supporting open collaboration both among the research community and beyond its traditional borders. Updates for both the content of CoCs as well as the processes of creating such guidelines are suggested.","- open science

,Open Science Austria 2017 - SPSS Rohdaten,"Open Science in Austria 2017

Based on the hypothesis that the currently heated debate on Open Science is shaped by strategic action to preserve the prevailing power relations rather than mutual understanding based on free recognition and equality, it is assumed that the respective position of power held by scientists within the scientific field, has an impact on their attitude towards an opening of science and the practical application of Open Science principles in their daily work.

To test this assumption, a quantitative online survey was conducted at eight Austrian universities (n=454) to ascertain each participating scientist’s position of power within the academic field. In a second step both the attitude of the participants toward seven predefined Open Science principles as well as their active application of these principles was empirically determined and analysed with regard to any possible correlation with their position of power.

NO,OSINT by Crowdsourcing: A Theoretical Model for Online Child Abuse Investigations,"For various reasons, the backlog of seized devices has increased to unparalleled levels, sometimes leading to years of delays in the trial process, even for online child abuse investigations. In addition to child abuse materials, the digital belongings of an abuser might contain small yet important pieces of information, such as nicknames, e-mails and place names. A thorough digital examination and an appropriate analysis of this set of information might reveal the exact locations or the real identities of criminal associates or victimized children. All these digital clues should be investigated properly through open sources, to identify the real identities of possible owners and discover whether their relationships with the suspect are crime-related. Considering the fact that thousands of such digital traces are present in all seized material for each separate investigation, a thorough examination of every piece of information related to a criminal case becomes a tremendously challenging issue for law enforcement agencies (LEAs). While the resources of LEAs are clearly insufficient, automated methods alone are not adequate to respond fully to current needs. In this regard, this article proposes a new and unorthodox way of handling the ever-growing workload of online child abuse investigators more effectively, by tapping into the energy of a carefully selected crowd of volunteers. After a brief literature review on related subjects, such as open source intelligence (OSINT) and crowdsourcing, in terms of their technical, legal and organizational aspects, the proposed theoretical model will be elaborated. Likely concerns and probable bottlenecks relating to the same respective aspects regarding successful actualization of the model will be identified and thoroughly discussed.","- OSINT, Crowdsourcing, Digital Forensics, Online Child Sexual Abuse, Criminal Investigations.",publication,Journal article,article,2018-10-21,10.5281/zenodo.1467896,1467896,10.5281/zenodo.1467897,1467897,- Kemal Veli Açar,

NO,Outreach Strategies to Engage Citizen Scientists: Insights from the Biodiversity Heritage Library,"How do you successfully engage volunteers in citizen science projects?

In recent years, citizen science has grown considerably in popularity, resulting in rapid increases in the number of citizen science and crowdsourcing projects and providing cost-effective means for scientists to gather more data over broader spatial ranges to tackle research questions in a wide variety of scientific, conservation, and environmental fields Bonney et al. 2016, Aceves-Bueno et al. 2017. While the proliferation of such projects has produced a growing abundance of citizen scientist-generated data and published research informed by citizen science methods Follett and Strezov 2015, this also means that volunteers have a greater number of projects competing for their time. 

When faced with an increasingly-crowded landscape, how can you generate interest in a citizen science or crowdsourcing project and maintain contributions over the project's lifetime?

The Biodiversity Heritage Library (BHL) supports a variety of citizen science and crowdsourcing projects, from transcribing field notes to tagging scientific illustrations with taxonomic names on Flickr and enhancing data for 19th century periodicals through its Zooniverse-based Science Gossip project. Through a variety of outreach strategies including collaborative social media campaigns, partnerships with citizen science communities, and interactive incentives, BHL has successfully engaged volunteers with diverse projects to enrich the library's data and increase discoverability of its collections.

This presentation will discuss outreach strategies for citizen science projects that BHL has undertaken to further support research initiatives with our content.

NO,Participatory design of citizen science experiments,"This article describes and analyzes the collaborative design of a citizen science research project through co-creation. Three groups of secondary school students and a team of scientists conceived three experiments on human behavior and social capital in urban and public spaces. The study goal is to address how interdisciplinary work and attention to social concerns and needs, as well as the collective construction of research questions, can be integrated into scientific research. The 95 students participating in the project answered a survey to evaluate their perception about the dynamics and tools used in the co-creation process of each experiment, and the five scientists responded to a semi-structured interview. The results from the survey and interviews demonstrate how citizen science can achieve a “co-created” modality beyond the usual “contributory” paradigm, which usually only involves the public or amateurs in data collection stages. This type of more collaborative science was made possible by the adaptation of materials and facilitation mechanisms, as well as the promotion of key aspects in research such as trust, creativity and transparency. The results also point to the possibility of adopting similar co-design strategies in other contexts of scientific collaboration and collaborative knowledge generation.","- citizen science

NO,Participatory Research: Extending Open Science beyond the ivory tower - Open Science Barcamp 2019,"This presentation was given at the Open Science Barcamp 2019 in Berlin.

Participatory research, that is when people who are not employed as scientists do research – on their own, in groups and potentially in cooperation with people who are employed as scientists. There are many different methodologies and approaches to participatory research, for instance DIY science, Community-based Research, Participatory Action Research and Citizen Science.

Such concepts are not often considered in discussions on Open Science, which are usually focussing on developments within scientific institutions. In my talk I will argue that it is important to extend the idea of Open Science beyond academia by considering another shade of openness – openness for participation of volunteers and cooperations with civil society organisations.

With a focus on Citizen Science, I will introduce a pluralistic concept of participatory research, highlight current developments and discuss challenges of this growing field of practice in Europe.","- Citizen Science, participatory research, Open Science",presentation,Presentation,,2019-04-30,10.5281/zenodo.2654993,2654993,10.5281/zenodo.2654994,2654994,- Claudia Göbel,eng
NO,Passive vs Active Knowledge Transfer: boosting grant proposal impact,"Research funders are increasingly concerned with measurable socio-economic impact of investment in research,
and on increasingly shorter timescales. Innovation, and “open innovation” are the policy priorities of the moment
and optimising the flow of ideas along the lab-2-market spectrum is essential for re-use of results, fuelling open
innovation, and boosting socio-economic impact or public funded research.


The presentation showcases two complimentary strategies that Project Managers can employ pre- and/or
post-award in order to optimise the exploitation and impact of research project: passive and active knowledge
transfer.

Passive Knowledge Transfer relies on maximum disclosure of research output (other than commercially exploitable
research via patents and other IPR) in the interest of optimal reproducibility, independent validation
and re-use by both academic and non-academic users, without necessarily targeting specific users. Tools of the
trade include standard public & academic dissemination means (research articles, online media publications,
newsletters, generic policy briefs).

Additional transparency of the research workflow can be achieved by integrating “open science” (open
notebooks, open data, open research software and open access to research publications) as well as Virtual
Research Environments (VREs) in the methodology of the proposed work.

Ensuring that the proposal partners are suitably trained in best practices of open science, makes proposal grant
more competitive at evaluation and the resulting maximum access to research outputs does contribute to better
return on investment for funders (Beagrie 2016) and economic growth objectives of public s e.g. Blue Growth
(Houghton & Swan 2011, Marine Knowledge 2020 Roadmap).

Active Knowledge Transfer, or the pro-active translation of research into policy or commercial context, is
the more classical and better known approach (also referred to as extension services, or researchers providing
advice e.g. to fisheries and aquaculture governance bodies and private sector). Horizon2020 COLUMBUS
Consortium proposes and tests a methodology for categorizing the diverse output of research into verifiable
“knowledge outputs” , and documenting the execution of an transfer plan to very specific and identified potential
users, in order to transfer knowledge along the lab-2-market spectrum.

The presentation will demonstrate how Open Science and detailed knowledge transfer plans complement
each other, enhance grant proposal evaluation pre- and post-award, and can address Blue Growth policy objectives.

NO,Planet Four: Probing springtime winds on Mars by mapping the southern polar CO2 jet deposits,"The springtime sublimation process of Mars’ southern seasonal polar CO2 ice cap features dark fan-shaped de- posits appearing on the top of the thawing ice sheet. The fan material likely originates from the surface below the ice sheet, brought up via CO2 jets breaking through the seasonal ice cap. Once the dust and dirt is released into the atmosphere, the material may be blown by the surface winds into the dark streaks visible from orbit. The location, size and direction of these fans record a number of parameters important to quantifying seasonal winds and sublimation activity, the most important agent of geological change extant on Mars. We present results of a systematic mapping of these south polar seasonal fans with the Planet Four online citizen science project. Planet Four enlists the general public to map the shapes, directions, and sizes of the seasonal fans visible in orbital images. Over 80,000 volunteers have contributed to the Planet Four project, reviewing 221 images, from Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter’s HiRISE (High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment) camera, taken in southern spring during Mars Years 29 and 30. We provide an overview of Planet Four and detail the processes of combining multiple volunteer assessments together to generate a high delity catalog of ∼ 400000 south polar seasonal fans.

NO,Plant Letters: A citizen science project uncovering historical biodiversity data,"The XIXth century saw an enormous accumulation of biological specimens coming to Europe from all over the world, which are now part of museums, herbaria and other natural history collections.

For many centuries, the exchange of letters was the privileged means of circulating information and knowledge. At the University of Coimbra (UC), the Life Sciences Department safeguards almost 5000 letters and other documentation addressed to directors, gardeners and other collaborators of the Botanic Garden. These records of Portuguese botanical science and expeditions of plant discovery, collection and identification are held in thousands of handwritten letters, species lists and assorted notebooks, in more than five different languages.

Historical repositories such as this archive, but also the biological and museum collections and objects that it documents, imply added responsibilities to the University of Coimbra, as the information contained within the documentation, pertains not only to a country (in this case Portugal), but also to its developing historical roles and actions. As a colonial power for many centuries, the records of Portuguese scientific activity and occupation strategies of overseas territories, in Africa, South America, Asia and the Pacific, are also documented, and its valuable data (e.g., historical biological records) is of crucial importance to these now independent countries. Received correspondence is a great resource for understanding the process of knowledge creation and circulation in the plant sciences, including botany and agriculture, as well as the scientific colonial practices and their implication for the amassing of biological collections at the UC.

In order to uncover historical biodiversity data within this archival material, we have implemented Plant Letters (https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/catedraunesco/plant-letters), a citizen science transcription project that seeks to uncover the stories within these historical archives, the tales of travelers and scientists, on the quest of recording of the world's diversity, mostly in the Portuguese ex-colonies in sub-Saharan Africa. Using the collaborative platform Zooniverse (https://www.zooniverse.org), users are requested to engage with the archive and transcribe mostly handwritten letters in several languages, giving dimension to our continuous efforts of promoting open and widespread access to information. The project invites everyone to transcribe handwritten or typed letters received by the Botanic Garden between about 1870 and 1928, from more than 1100 correspondents from around the world.

The main purpose of this project is to track plant species, locations and scientists in the correspondence received in the 19th and 20th centuries at the Botanic Garden of the University of Coimbra. To do so, Plant Letters seeks in users, both experts or simply curious, a source of participation in the construction of knowledge, making use of collective intelligence, in a lively exchange of information, experiences and knowledge.

In transcribing the letters, we want to retrieve information that can include:

inquiries and doubts about plant classification and taxonomy; historical plant species locations, distribution records and abundance; biological material circulation (plant and seed exchanges); track the path of herbarium and museum specimens in our collections; unravel networks of botanical knowledge.

Transcribing the information contained in these documents will allow us to: track plant specimens as they travelled from their native countries to the scientists who named them; to determine historical plant locations in parts of sub-Saharan Africa; to better understand the scientific processes of plant discovery, taxonomy and botany; and to collect information that gives context to biological specimens in museum objects and other natural history collections. All of these data, valuable to the present and future conservation of tropical flora, will be made available, bearing in mind the open science principles.","- historical biological records

NO,Plazi – on expedition to discover known biodiversity,"Lecture presented August 10, 2018, New York Botanical Garden

Biodiversity is an intricate part of our daily life, from creating our oxygen, providing our food, lining and cleaning the streets of our cities to being the source of an ongoing scientific challenge our community follows with full of verve: how many species are there? The estimated more than 500 Million pages of scholarly publications with an intricate, implicit web of citations, and a couple of billion specimens in thousands of natural history institutions are the best witness of this relentless drive. The digital age, however, points the finger mercilessly to the fact that we don’t know what we actually accumulated over the centuries, i.e. what we supposedly could know.

This lecture describes the expeditions Plazi undertakes to uncover the vast troves of data and citations contained in the published record. This will cover some of the first findings it exposes in both human and machine readable formats at TreatmentBank for taxonomic treatments, the Biodiversity Literature Repository for scholarly figures, and the fledgling Openbiodiv biodiversity knowledge management system based on the uncovered citations. It will end with suggestions how this knowledge can be made immediately accessible upon publishing, bridging the gap from publication to the underlying data, mainly the specimens housed in the natural history collections, genomic databases and citizen science networks.

A discussion with the audience on strategies to enhance the efficiency of the expeditions is wanted.","- biodiversity

The Consortium for Research and Innovation in Aerospace in Quebec (CRIAQ) lunched project MD0505 that can be inserted in this crow-ded frame. The target of this cooperation, involving Canadian and Italian academies and a research centre, is the development of a camber ""morphing aileron"" integrated on an in-novative full scale wing tip of the next generation regional aircraft. This paper focuses on the preliminary design and the numerical modeling of its architecture.

WYRED (netWorked Youth Research for Empowerment in the Digital society) is a European H2020 Project that aims to provide a framework for research in which children and young people can express and explore their perspectives and interests in relation to digital society, but also a platform from which they can communicate their perspectives to other stakeholders effectively through innovative engagement processes. It will do this by implementing a generative research cycle involving networking, dialogue, participatory research and interpretation phases centered around and driven by children and young people, out of which a diverse range of outputs, critical perspectives and other insights will emerge to inform policy and decision-making in relation to children and young people’s needs in relation to digital society. The WYRED Platform is already developed, but the target group, young people, should accept it to ensure project aims.

NO,Project Paleo: Citizen Curation and Community Science at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County,"The School and Teacher Programs of the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County have partnered with the La Brea Tar Pits and Museum (LBTPM) and the Invertebrate Paleontology (LACMIP) collection to create two ""citizen curation"" exercises dubbed ""Project Paleo"". Classroom kits were created with unsorted fossils from either LBPTM or from a local invertebrate paleontological field site, to be sorted and identified by local elementary and middle school students and then returned to the museum for curation, analysis, and research purposes. Each kit contains background information about the project and fossils, and an identification guide to assist the students and teachers.

The ""Project Paleo: Rancho La Brea"" kit contains three tablespoons of unsorted fossil matrix from LBTPM's Project 23. Groups of students learn about past and present food webs of the Los Angeles Basin, then sort the matrix into several categories (bones, plants, other fossils, and rocks) using a guide with drawn examples of each. An online iNaturalist (inaturalist.org) project also serves as an identification resource as well as a platform by which students can contribute photos for identification by staff researchers. This project is aimed at middle schoolers and over 700 students have used the sorting kits. Results will help to recreate past ecosystems of Southern California and help to inform a National Science Foundation (NSF) funded project, ""A Mouse's Eye View of Rancho La Brea"".

The ""Project Paleo: Marine Invertebrates of Southern California"" kit produced by LACMIP, contains approximately two cups of washed but unsorted coarse fossil matrix from a salvaged (now destroyed) construction site. This kit is aimed at 5th grade Los Angeles Unified School District classrooms and homeschooling families. Students are asked to sort fossils by species and use included identification cards to identify the sorted fossils to the best of their ability. Results of this project will be included in an NSF funded digitization project and will contribute to research on the paleoecology of Pleistocene Southern California.

Early evaluation of both kits has shown positive feedback from students and educators, as well as some room to improve instructions to students. These kits are designed to conform to Next Generation Science Standards while generating useful data for museum scientists. Collections staff are able to outsource the curation of critical data to students who get the experience of handling real museum fossils and contributing to the body of paleontological research.","- microfossil

NO,Qualitätskriterien für Citizen Science Projekte auf Österreich forscht,"Die Plattform Österreich forscht (www.citizen-science.at) wurde 2014 mit den Zielen gegründet, (1) Citizen Science Akteurinnen und Akteure in Österreich zu vernetzen, (2) einen möglichst umfassenden Überblick über Citizen Science Projekte in Österreich zu geben und (3) allgemein die Methodik Citizen Science wissenschaftlich weiter zu entwickeln.

Viele Institutionen, welche in Citizen Science aktiv sind, haben sich 2017 auf Initiative der Plattform Österreich forscht im Citizen Science Network Austria zusammengeschlossen und sich damit dazu bekannt, die Qualität von Citizen Science in Österreich zu fördern (http://www.citizen-science.at/die-plattform/das-netzwerk).

Ein wichtiger Schritt zur Förderung dieser Qualität war es, transparente Kriterien aufzustellen, die jene Projekte erfüllen müssen, welche auf der Plattform Österreich forscht gelistet werden möchten. Das Ziel dieser Kriterien ist, die Qualität der auf der Plattform  vorgestellten Projekte weiter hochzuhalten und noch zu steigern.

Von März 2017 bis Februar 2018 hat daher eine Arbeitsgruppe der Plattform Österreich forscht, bestehend aus Vertreterinnen und Vertretern von 17 Institutionen, Kriterien ausgearbeitet, die eine transparente Bewertung jener Projekte ermöglichen, die auf Österreich forscht gelistet werden möchten. Die Ausarbeitung erfolgte in mehreren Schritten, wobei zusätzlich zum Wissen der Arbeitsgruppenmitglieder auch mehrmals Feedback von externen Expertinnen und Experten aus den jeweiligen Fachbereichen eingearbeitet wurde. Um auch das Wissen der Bevölkerung in die Kriterien einfließen lassen zu können, wurde über den gesamten Oktober 2017 hinweg ein Entwurf der Qualitätskriterien für eine öffentliche Onlinekonsultation auf der Plattform Österreich forscht freigegeben.

Die finale Version der Qualitätskriterien wurde im Rahmen der 4. Österreichischen Citizen Science Konferenz, 1.-3. Februar 2018, der Öffentlichkeit präsentiert. Mit diesem Datum haben die Qualitätskriterien ihre Gültigkeit erlangt. Bereits gelistete Projekte auf Österreich forscht haben die Möglichkeit, sich den Kriterien innerhalb eines Jahres anzupassen. Projekte, welche neu auf Österreich forscht gelistet werden möchten, müssen diese Kriterien bei Listung erfüllen.

Die Qualitätskriterien werden zukünftig nach Bedarf adaptiert, um neuen Herausforderungen und Entwicklungen gerecht zu werden. Die Versionsnummer der Kriterien, welcher ein Projekt entspricht, wird auf der jeweiligen Projektseite angegeben.

Der erste Teil der Kriterien dient vor allem der Feststellung, was ein Citizen Science Projekt ausmacht. Hier haben wir uns zu einer Negativliste entschlossen (d.h. wir legen fest, was alles NICHT Citizen Science ist), um die Plattform möglichst offen für unterschiedliche Konzepte, Herangehensweisen und Disziplinen zu halten. Die Kriterien im zweiten Teil sind als Mindeststandards zu verstehen, welche alle Projekte auf Österreich forscht erfüllen müssen.

Die Evaluierung erfolgt durch die Koordinatorinnen und Koordinatoren der Plattform Österreich forscht unter Beratung von Mitarbeiterinnen und Mitarbeitern der Arbeitsgruppe.

NO,Quality Criteria for Citizen Science Projects on Österreich forscht,"The platform Österreich forscht was founded in 2014 with the objectives of (1) connecting citizen science actors in Austria, (2) providing the broadest possible overview of citizen science projects in Austria, and (3) scientifically advancing citizen science as a method.

Following the initiative of the platform Österreich forscht, many of the institutions that are active in citizen science joined forces in the Citizen Science Network Austria in 2017, and thus agreed to advance the quality of citizen science in Austria.

An important step in this regard was the establishment of transparent criteria for projects wishing to be listed on the platform Österreich forscht. The objective of these criteria is to maintain and further improve the quality of the projects presented on the platform.

Between March 2017 and February 2018, a working group of the platform Österreich forscht consisting of representatives from 17 institutions developed criteria that allow for the transparent evaluation of projects applying to be listed on Österreich forscht. This was a multi-stage process, building both on the knowledge of the working group members as well as on feedback repeatedly provided by external experts from the respective research fields. Throughout October 2017, a version of the quality criteria was available for public online consultation on the platform Österreich forscht, so as to incorporate the knowledge of the general public into the criteria as well.

The final version of the quality criteria was presented at the 4th Austrian Citizen Science Conference, 1-3 February 2018, at which point the criteria also came into effect. Projects already listed on Österreich forscht can adapt to meet the criteria over the next year. Projects wishing to be newly listed on Österreich forscht must meet these criteria at the point of listing.

Where necessary, the quality criteria will be adapted in the future, in order to respond to new challenges and developments. The version number, i.e. which version of the criteria a project corresponds to, will be indicated on the respective project page.

The first part of the criteria is primarily aimed at establishing what defines a citizen science project. Here, we decided on a negative list (i.e. projects that are NOT citizen science), in order to be as open as possible to different concepts and disciplines.

The criteria in the second part are to be understood as minimum standards which all projects listed on the platform Österreich forscht must fulfil.

The evaluation will be carried out by the coordinators of the platform Österreich forscht in consultation with working group members.

,"Quantitative account of social interactions in a mental health care ecosystem: cooperation, trust and collective action","Mental disorders have an enormous impact in our society, both in personal terms and in the economic costs associated with their treatment. In order to scale up services and bring down costs, administrations are starting to promote social interactions as key to care provision. We analyze quantitatively the importance of communities for effective mental health care, considering all community members involved. By means of citizen science practices, we have designed a suite of games that allow to probe into different behavioral traits of the role groups of the ecosystem. The evidence reinforces the idea of community social capital, with caregivers and professionals playing a leading role. Yet, the cost of collective action is mainly supported by individuals with a mental condition - which unveils their vulnerability. The results are in general agreement with previous findings but, since we broaden the perspective of previous studies, we are also able to find marked differences in the social behavior of certain groups of mental disorders. We finally point to the conditions under which cooperation among members of the ecosystem is better sustained, suggesting how virtuous cycles of inclusion and participation can be promoted in a ’care in the community’ framework.","- mental health care

,Resource heterogeneity leads to unjust effort distribution in climate change mitigation,"Climate change mitigation is a shared global challenge that involves the collective action of a set of individuals with different tendencies to cooperation. However, we lack an understanding of the effect of resource inequality when diverse actors interact together toward a common goal. Here, we report the results of a collective-risk dilemma experiment in which groups of individuals were initially given either equal or unequal endowments. We found that the effort distribution was highly inequitable, with participants with fewer resources contributing significantly more to the public goods than the richer - sometimes twice as much. An unsupervised learning algorithm classified the subjects according to their individual behavior, finding the poorest participants within two ""generous clusters'"" and the richest into a ""greedy cluster''. Our results suggest that policies would benefit from educating about fairness and reinforcing climate justice actions addressed to vulnerable people instead of focusing on understanding generic or global climate consequences.

NO,Science and citizenship: Capacity building for civic engagement through the MammalWeb citizen science project,"Selected as Best Talk at the December 2017 British Ecological Society annual meeting.

Abstract of talk

Citizen science is increasingly utilised for ecological research. By crowdsourcing the capture and/or classification of scientific data, ecologists can increase the scope and resolution of the questions they tackle. Techniques for producing high quality citizen science data have led to advances in fields from plant-pollinator interactions to phenology. Here we present the potential for citizen science to stimulate civic engagement on ecological issues. Our project – MammalWeb (www.MammalWeb.org @MammalWeb) – involves citizen scientists in monitoring local mammals of northeast England with camera traps. Since 2015, we have amassed >150,000 volunteer-captured wildlife images which are collaboratively classified on our publicly accessible website. In addition to the collection and classification of data by citizen scientists, we attempted to guide them in becoming ecological “ambassadors”. With support from a British Ecological Society Outreach Grant, we partnered with Belmont Community School and worked with a group of mainly UK Year Nine students during 2016-2017. The students not only participated in MammalWeb for data capture and classification, but were also empowered to design outreach activities for their local community. This included a community fair and filming a short documentary to share the project with a wide audience. I will also describe how the students’ outreach and the MammalWeb citizen science project in general may stimulate civic engagement on ecological issues. Participants reported an increased awareness of their local wildlife which is unlikely to have been achieved with classroom learning. Additionally, MammalWeb citizen scientists provided data leading to the capture of a non-native species and substantially improved understanding of mammal fauna informing plans for a Local Nature Reserve (LNR). Some have initiated their own camera trap projects in County Durham, England and Galloway, Scotland. This demonstrates the potential of citizen science to engage the public on ecology-related policy-making, useful in a world of rapid ecological change.

NO,Science and Management of Intermittent Rivers and Ephemeral Streams (SMIRES),"More than half of the global river network is composed of intermittent rivers and ephemeral streams (IRES), which are expanding in response to climate change and increasing water demands. After years of obscurity, the science of IRES has bloomed recently and it is being recognised that IRES support a unique and high biodiversity, provide essential ecosystem services and are functionally part of river networks and groundwater systems. However, they still lack protective and adequate management, thereby jeopardizing water resources at the global scale. This Action brings together hydrologists, biogeochemists, ecologists, modellers, environmental economists, social researchers and stakeholders from 14 different countries to develop a research network for synthesising the fragmented, recent knowledge on IRES, improving our understanding of IRES and translating this into a science-based, sustainable management of river networks. Deliverables will be provided through i) research workshops synthesising and addressing key challenges in IRES science, supporting research exchange and educating young researchers, and ii) researcher-stakeholder workshops translating improved knowledge into tangible tools and guidelines for protecting IRES and raising awareness of their importance and value in societal and decision-maker spheres. This Action is organized within six Working Groups to address: (i) the occurrence, distribution and hydrological trends of IRES; (ii) the effects of flow alterations on IRES functions and services; (iii) the interaction of aquatic and terrestrial biogeochemical processes at catchment scale; (iv) the biomonitoring of the ecological status of IRES; (v) synergies in IRES research at the European scale, data assemblage and sharing; (vi) IRES management and advocacy training.","- Flow intermittence

NO,Science at High Schools - Collaboration between Researchers and Students,"In the text, high school students involvement in research activities is explored. The paper contains three parts. The first part presents the theoretical backgrounds of the relationship between science and civil society, and the concept as well as concrete examples of the Citizen Science. The second part reports the results of a pilot study (sondage) in which the students from five (Slovenian) High Schools expressed their views regarding the meaning and significance of the ecology and sustainable development. In the third part, so-called group-feedback analysis with the participation of students is considered, regarded as a contribution to the concept of the Citizen Science Experiment. The results show that the students are getting solid knowledge on ecological and environmental issues, especially in biology courses, however there is a certain lack of more integral didactic approaches while students’ interests seem to be rather declarative and pragmatic (school-centric).","- citizen science, high schools, ecology, sustainable development, civil society, environmental studies, biology, sociology",publication,Journal article,article,2018-10-10,10.5281/zenodo.1454510,1454510,10.5281/zenodo.1454511,1454511,"- Frane Adam

NO,Science Ecosystem 2.0: how will change occur?,"The report analyses the potential impact of a transition towards Open Science on the stakeholders of the research ecosystem. The following findings are discussed.

Innovative digital tools that facilitate communication, collaboration, and the data analysis will enable Open Science practices.
All stakeholders of the research ecosystem will benefit from Open Science, although it will change work habits and business models.
Digital platforms will facilitate innovation by streamlining all phases of the innovation process, from the generation of ideas to experimental work and fundraising.
Citizens will become new players of the research ecosystem. They will shape science policies and contribute to scientific research through citizen science actions and by funding researchers.
Digital science start-ups will shape the future of Open Science and innovate in the exploitation of the flow of information made publicly available with the advent of Open Science.
The EU can accelerate the transition towards Open Science thanks to its unique position as funder and policy maker. A three-step program is suggested that will: 1) support the on-going transformation; 2) make systemic change to open the way to fully implemented Open Science; and 3) unlock the societal and economic value of Open Science.","- Open Science

NO,Semi-automatic Extraction of Plants Morphological Characters from Taxonomic Descriptions Written in Spanish,"Taxonomic literature keeps records of the planet's biodiversity and gives access to the knowledge needed for its sustainable management. Unfortunately, most of the taxonomic information is available in scientific publications in text format. The amount of publications generated is very large; therefore, to process it in order to obtain high structured texts would be complex and very expensive. Approaches like citizen science may help the process by selecting whole fragments of texts dealing with morphological descriptions; but a deeper analysis, compatible with accepted ontologies, will require specialised tools. The Biodiversity Heritage Library (BHL) estimates that there are more than 120 million pages published in over 5.4 million books since 1469, plus about 800,000 monographs and 40,000 journal titles (12,500 of these are current titles).

It is necessary to develop standards and software tools to extract, integrate and publish this information into existing free and open access repositories of biodiversity knowledge to support science, education and biodiversity conservation.

This document presents an algorithm based on computational linguistics techniques to extract structured information from morphological descriptions of plants written in Spanish. The developed algorithm is based on the work of Dr. Hong Cui from the University of Arizona; it uses semantic analysis, ontologies and a repository of knowledge acquired from the same descriptions. The algorithm was applied to the books Trees of Costa Rica Volume III (TCRv3), Trees of Costa Rica Volume IV (TCRv4) and to a subset of descriptions of the Manual of Plants of Costa Rica (MPCR) with very competitive results (more than 92.5% of average performance). The system receives the morphological descriptions in tabular format and generates XML documents. The XML schema allows documenting structures, characters and relations between characters and structures. Each extracted object is associated with attributes like name, value, modifiers, restrictions, ontology term id, amongst other attributes.

The implemented tool is free software. It was developed using Java and integrates existing technology as FreeLing, the Plant Ontology (PO), the Plant Glossary, the Ontology Term Organizer (OTO) and the Flora Mesoamericana English-Spanish Glossary.","- Information Extraction

NO,"Setting Collections Data Free with the Power of the Crowd: challenges, opportunities and a vision for the future","The Natural History Museum in London has embarked on an epic journey to digitise 80 million specimens from one of the world's most important natural history collections. Publishing this data to our open Data Portal will give the global scientific community access to unrivalled historical, geographic and taxonomic specimen data gathered over the last 250 years. We have been involving the public in this large task by asking digital volunteers to help transcribe information written on specimen labels, via an online crowdsourcing interface, such that anyone in the world can participate. In this talk we will share our experience with these projects over the past year.

Within the Digital Collections Programme at the Natural History Museum London we have so far digitally imaged approximately 200,000 of our total holdings of around two million microscope slides, and from these have selected two discrete collections for crowdsourcing the transcription effort. Miniature Lives Magnified (now complete) contained 6,285 digitised Chalcidoidea slides from our Hymenoptera collection, and Miniature Fossils Magnified (not yet complete at time of writing) contains 2,000 Foraminifera slides from our Micropalaeontology collection. Both projects are hosted on the Notes from Nature platform, which has been built on the Zooniverse Panoptes open-project platform.

As the lead partner of the Crowdsourcing task within SYNTHESYS3, an EC-funded project creating an integrated European infrastructure for natural history collections, we have partnered with our fellow consortium members to help them design and launch crowdsourcing projects of their own. These have included an Amaranthaceae collection with 444 specimens and a Primulaceae collection with 3,093 specimens hosted on Notes from Nature, and a Brachiopod collection with 1,810 specimens built directly on Panoptes.

In this talk we will share the key insights gained through practical experience with this wide range of specimens, specimen data, and label-styles. In particular, we have gained insights into the design of the workflow and interface, such as the considerable reduction in human error when drop-down menu options are introduced where possible, rather than free data entry fields.

These five projects provided us with a unique opportunity to compare the dedicated Notes from Nature platform, which has significant advantages due to the size and engagement-level of the existing community, to the open project-building Panoptes platform, which has storytelling advantages in terms of the capacity to provide more information about a specific collection, its subject, and its underlying scientific importance.

A crucial element of running successful crowdsourcing projects is building an engaged community of digital volunteers. We compared the use of social media channels with more traditional Museum communication channels (such as e-newsletter and website), and found that the latter had the most reach in terms of raising awareness of the projects, but that the former enabled more frequent and varied engagement with a potential volunteer audience. However, when examining which metrics are the most important to track in assessing the success of various initiatives, we found that the highest impact on the ultimate volume of transcription were in-house volunteering days run in person, rather than online.

In reaching out and engaging with a diverse range of volunteer audiences, we found evidence of the major sources of motivation that are described in the existing citizen science literature, but also more nuanced insight into behaviours such as pursuing independent learning, the desire to enter all of the information even when not requested, and preferring tasks that can be performed by rote. Our efforts to support and nurture the existing Notes from Nature community confirmed the importance of the principle of 'giving-back', and gave us insight into how to do this when research results emerge over a longer timeline than is typical of field-based citizen science projects.

And finally, we will share our experience with the behind-the-scenes elements of crowdsourcing - the parts the 'crowd' doesn't see - such as data quality assessment, data ingestion, data publication, and the flow of data between internal systems.

In conclusion we will propose some visions of the future, such as moving towards a global platform for specimen label transcription with a shared underlying database infrastructure, how to deepen the engagement of digital volunteers from transcription tasks to scientific observations, and ways to bring online crowdsourcing and field-based citizen science together in a more streamlined way.","- Citizen Science

NO,Sharing knowledge – Innovative Solutions from New Zealand Taxonomic Collections,"Manaaki Whenua - Landcare Research (MWLR) is the custodian of nearly a third of New Zealand's nationally significant natural history collections and databases. MWLR is a New Zealand Government-owned Research Institute whose purpose is to drive innovation in the management of terrestrial biodiversity and land resources. Active research programmes are associated with the collections and innovative projects to disseminate the resulting knowledge to the public have been developed. A number of these projects have focused on two-way sharing of knowledge and information with Māori, Aotearoa/New Zealand's first people. Examples of science projects combining collections resources, community knowledge and research to produce bilingual guides, websites and teaching tools include:

Ahi Pepe | Mothnet, a citizen science project that engages teachers, students and Māori with nature and science across New Zealand What is this bug?, a web-based invertebrate identification guide with bilingual translation (He Aha Tēnei Pepeke) Ngā Hekaheka o Aotearoa, a bilingual teaching resource combining scientific research with Māori ancestral knowledge and usage of fungi. Discover New Life, a project where researchers worked with students to discover and describe species new to science National New Zealand Flax Collection (HARAKEKE) , a living plant collection of weaving varieties of harakeke (NZ flax), providing plants and associated website resources on research, cultivation and traditional usage of harakeke for Māori weavers and the broader community.

These projects have allowed development of ongoing relationships and knowledge sharing between MWLR natural history collections and New Zealand communities, enriching the collections and associated data for all.","- Citizen Science

NO,"Sharing more widely: data at the heart of evidence, policy and transformation at Defra","Defra (the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs) and its network of arm’s length bodies – the Environment Agency, Natural England, the Marine Management Organisation, Kew Gardens, the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquatic Science and the Animal and Plant Health Agency – produce large amounts of data. This has been instrumental in providing evidence to support the development and delivery of key policies. 
 
Historically, expertise has been embedded in subjectspecific areas, resulting in data existing in silos with varying degrees of accessibility for those within the department, wider government and wider society. In 2015, Defra’s Secretary of State declared that more than 8000 of Defra’s datasets would be made freely available for anyone to access, use and share. Doing so creates opportunities for everyone – not just those making their living in food, farming and the environment. Opening access to Defra’s data is intended to both provide opportunities to those who wish to use it to exploit its business potential, and to improve policy delivery by engaging a wider community in solving problems.  
 
The Department has been focused on making datasets available as open data; ensuring future data collection and publication approaches are open by default, taking a transparent approach from the outset. This will make it easier to work more collaboratively with other government bodies, external partners and the public.  
 
Alongside growing support for citizen science activities, new technologies are changing the way in which data flows. This presents opportunities for government as much as for others. Today’s smartphones, for example, have the computing power of the supercomputers of 30 years ago. When coupled with a growing range of accurate sensors, 
smartphones potentially allow the move away from environmental monitoring depending on sparse, fixed, high-accuracy, expensive monitoring stations, replacing them with mobile, cheap, lower accuracy but more densely populated networks, which could be carried on vehicles such as buses or taxis in addition to being supported by the capability of smartphones.   
 
There is already a move towards crowdsourced data for biodiversity measurement (supported by the National Biodiversity Network). Many people, connected together and using mobile phone technology, could revolutionise country-wide data collection that is sufficient to address policy needs. In future, machine learning may allow species recognition by the smartphone in real time when connected to cloud-based software. This kind of completely integrated software and hardware capability is broadly described by the potential of internet-of things-devices. These have the potential to revolutionise the farm: from making comparisons on productivity, to tracing the journey of food from field to fork. 
 
Defra is also explore the use of real-time data from earth observation and remote sensing to respond to incidents such as floods, invasive species, pollution and epidemics affecting livestock. Opportunities form these types of data sources are often balanced by challenges associated with transforming systems to be more data-driven and to ensure that, in areas that are business-critical, the data sources are assured.  
 
Complex decision-making is already supported by modelling that often requires data flows from multiple sources. Machine learning has the potential to increase the automation and speed of data assimilation in to models For example, this could mean using these technologies to inform policies that reward farmers for acting in ways that maximise positive national outcomes. In this particular instance and more widely, however, this comes at the risk of taking human subjectivity and its political and moral weight out of processes.  
 
In future data volumes will be a major challenge. While compression algorithms may improve it is not going to be possible to store all raw data. This is going to require real-time processing of data to provide intermediate outputs. Judgements will need to be made about what data needs to be kept and how to implement intelligent compression focused on the ultimate use.  
 
The main ethical challenges around data concern personal information, including observance of legislation on data protection and more recent legislation on the right to be forgotten. Defra is working both internally, among its network of agencies, and with its data users to ensure these rights are fully respected. However, data ethics extends beyond just consideration of personal data: 

 
 
there are sensitivities around some datasets for which Defra shares custody, and others where there are implications for civic, national or cyber security. Some data are also commercially sensitive. There may be additional sensitivities where data concerns reporting of environmental monitoring and enforcing regulation. 
 
Funding reforms have also been a major driver for change. Finding innovative ways to save money, but deliver a high quality service, remains a departmental mission – new data policies can help to transform some of the department’s ways of working. Adopting an ‘open by default’ approach has impacts beyond data, as working openly allows more efficient collaborative working that avoids duplication, saves money, and allows crosspollination of ideas across the Defra group. 
 
Defra is looking more broadly at how to obtain, analyse and manage data (tools, techniques and storage) to further drive innovation. This has been demonstrated by the recently established Earth Observation Centre of Excellence. This centre aims to ensure satellite data is used to its full potential in policy development and operations across Defra by 2020, via a collaborative group of Defra organisations and external partners. A recent success was during the severe weather in December 2015: the centre facilitated better involvement and communication across departments on flood estimates of non-urban areas using radar satellite systems","- environment data

NO,Shining a New Light on Elmer Ottis Wooton's Legacy Herbarium and Historical Archive: an Exercise to Increase Student Participation while Promoting Public Engagement,"Elmer Ottis Wooton (1865–1945) was one of the most important early botanists to work in the Southwestern United States, contributing a great deal of natural history knowledge and botanical research on the flora of New Mexico that shaped many naturalists and scientists for generations. The extensive Wooton legacy includes herbarium collections that he and his famous student Paul Carpenter Standley (1884–1963), prolific botanist and explorer, used for the first Flora of New Mexico by Wooten and Standley 1915 , along with resources covering botany and range management strategies for the northern Chihuahuan Desert, and an extensive, yet to be digitized, historical archive of correspondence, field notes, vegetation sketches, photographs, and lantern slides, all from his travels and field work in the region. Starting in 1890, the most complete set of Wooton's herbarium collections were deposited in the NMC herbarium at New Mexico State University (NMSU), and his archives, now stored in a Campus library, have together been underutilized, offline resources.

The goals of this ongoing project are to secure, preserve, and promote Wooton's important historical resources, by fleshing out the botanical history of the region, raising appreciation of herbarium collections within the community, and emphasizing their unique role in facilitating contemporary research aimed at addressing pressing scientific questions such as vegetation responses to global climate change. Students and the general public involved in this project are engaged through hands-on activities including cataloging, databasing and digitization of nearly 10,000 herbarium specimens and Wooton's archives. These outputs, combined with contemporary data collection and computational biology techniques from an ecological perspective, are being used to document vegetation changes in iconic, climate-sensitive, high-elevation mountainous ecosystems present in southwestern New Mexico. In a later phase of the project, a variety of public audiences will participate through interactive online story maps and citizen science programs such as iNaturalist, Notes from Nature, and BioBlitz. Images of herbarium specimens will be shared via an online database and other relevant biodiversity portals (Symbiota, iDigBio, JStor)

Community members reached through this project will be better-informed citizens, who may go on to become new stewards of natural history collections, with the potential to influence policies safeguarding the future of our planet's biodiversity. More locally, the project will support the management of Organ Mountains Desert Peaks National Monument, which was established in 2014 to protect the area's human and environmental resources, and for which knowledge and data are currently limited.","- Wooton

NO,Should Citizen Scientists Play with Ecosystem Models?,"A series of recent events has fuelled a hot debate over the transparency and credibility of climate research. While the debate between sceptics and believers may continue, the circumstances have provided good context for “citizen science” to spill over into climate research.

The concept is not a new one and already applied in astronomy & planetary science, archaeology and biodiversity studies. The idea is that volunteers participate in tasks where human perception and common sense are needed, without the time-consuming scientific training. So could the concept work in something as technical, multi-disciplinary and complex as Global Climate Change modelling?

Earlier this year, the Clear Climate Code Project (CCC; http://clearclimatecode.org) set up by the staff of the Cambridge-based Ravenbrook Limited software engineering consultancy (http://www.ravenbrook.com), published their own version of NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies GIS-TEMP Model.

CCC is a volunteer-based project founded on the premise that “The results of some climate-related software are used as the basis for important public policy decisions. If the software is not clearly correct, decision-making will be obscured by debates about it”. The goals of the small group of software engineers are to: 1) produce clear climate science software; 2) encourage the production of clear climate science software; 3) increase public confidence in climate science results, without judgement or arbitration of climate science.","- citizen science

Description

SONYC Urban Sound Tagging (SONYC-UST) is a dataset for the development and evaluation of machine listening systems for realistic urban noise monitoring. The audio was recorded from the SONYC acoustic sensor network. Volunteers on the Zooniverse citizen science platform tagged the presence of 23 classes that were chosen in consultation with the New York City Department of Environmental Protection. These 23 fine-grained classes can be grouped into 8 coarse-grained classes. The recordings are split into three subsets: training, validation, and test. These sets are disjoint with respect to the sensor from which each recording came. For increased reliability, three volunteers annotated each recording, and members of the SONYC team subsequently created a set of ground-truth tags for the validation set using a two-stage annotation procedure in which two annotators independently tagged and then collectively resolved any disagreements. For more details on the motivation and creation of this dataset see the DCASE 2019 Urban Sound Tagging Task website.

 

Audio data

The provided audio has been acquired using the SONYC acoustic sensor network for urban noise pollution monitoring. Over 50 different sensors have been deployed in New York City, and these sensors have collectively gathered the equivalent of 37 years of audio data, of which we provide a small subset. The data was sampled by selecting the nearest neighbors on VGGish features of recordings known to have classes of interest. All recordings are 10 seconds and were recorded with identical microphones at identical gain settings. To maintain privacy, the recordings in this release have been distributed in time and location, and the time and location of the recordings are not included in the metadata.

The classes preceded by an X code indicate when an annotator was able to identify the coarse class, but couldn’t identify the fine class because either they were uncertain which fine class it was or the fine class was not included in the taxonomy. dcase-ust-taxonomy.yaml contains this taxonomy in an easily machine-readable form.

 

Data splits

This release contains a training subset (2351 recordings), and validation subset (443 recordings), and a test subset (274 recordings). The training and validation subsets are disjoint with respect to the sensor from which each recording came, and were chosen such that the distribution of citizen science provided labels were similar for each split. The sensors in the test set are not disjoint from the training and validation subsets, but the test recordings are displaced in time, occurring after any of the recordings in the training and validation subset.

 

Annotation data

The annotation data are contained in annotations.csv, and encompass the training, validation, and test subsets. Each row in the file represents one multi-label annotation of a recording—it could be the annotation of a single citizen science volunteer, a single SONYC team member, or the agreed-upon ground truth by the SONYC team (see the annotator_id column description for more information).

 

 

Columns

split

The data split. (train, validate, test)

sensor_id

The ID of the sensor the recording is from. These have been anonymized to have no relation to geolocation.

audio_filename

The filename of the audio recording

annotator_id

The anonymous ID of the annotator. If this values is positive, it is a citizen science volunteer from the Zooniverse platform. If it is negative, it is a SONYC team member (only present for validation set). If it is 0, then it is the ground truth agreed-upon by the SONYC team.

<coarse_id>-<fine_id>_<fine_name>_presence

Columns of this form indicate the presence of fine-level class. 1 if present, 0 if not present. If -1, then the class wasn’t labeled in this annotation because the annotation was performed by a SONYC team member who only annotated one coarse group of classes at a time when annotating the validation set.

<coarse_id>_<coarse_name>_presence

Columns of this form indicate the presence of a coarse-level class. 1 if present, 0 if not present. If -1, then the class wasn’t labeled in this annotation because the annotation was performed by a SONYC team member who only annotated one coarse group of classes at a time when annotating the validation set. These columns are computed from the fine-level class presence columns and are presented here for convenience when training on only coarse-level classes.

<coarse_id>-<fine_id>_<fine_name>_proximity

Columns of this form indicate the proximity of a fine-level class. After indicating the presence of a fine-level class, citizen science annotators were asked to indicate the proximity of the sound event to the sensor. Only the citizen science volunteers performed this task, and therefore this data is included for training but not validation. This columns can take on four values: (near, far, notsure, -1). If -1, then the proximity was not annotated because either the annotation wasn’t performed by a citizen science volunteer, or the citizen science volunteer did not indicate the presence of the class.

NO,Standardizing Citizen Science?,"Citizen science engages members of the public in collecting and mobilizing information for research and decision-making. While citizen science is well known for supporting biodiversity research and monitoring at national and global scales, many projects also engage the public in areas including local environmental monitoring and participatory health research. Beyond data collection, volunteers increasingly participate in all stages of the scientific research process, including data analysis and project or protocol design. 

The use of standards can help scientists and volunteers collect, exchange, and understand information within and beyond the initial data collection context. But the state of data standardization and interoperability in citizen science is currently limited. Not all projects wish to collect standardized data or make their data open for re-use. Further, diverse stakeholders including community members, regulatory agencies, and research scientists, may disagree about what types of information are relevant and what formats information should take Gobel et al. 2017. And while citizen science is valued as a method that can help address complex global problems, integrating a range of interdisciplinary data from diverse sources, as required by projects like Global Mosquito Alert Bowser et al. 2017, can be a formidable technical challenge. 

In 2015, a consortium of individuals dedicated to understanding and addressing these challenges was formalized through the Data and Metadata Working Group of the Citizen Science Association (CSA). The Working Group is making progress on a number of challenges, including developing an evolving data and metadata standard and ontology called Public Participation in Scientific Research CORE, or PPSR_CORE Cavalier et al. 2015. To be effective and impactful, PPSR_CORE will need to be compatible with existing standards like Darwin Core, and also develop a shared vocabulary for documenting important aspects of participation like data quality and fitness for purpose. This talk explores the social and technical challenges of standardizing citizen science, shares the efforts already underway, and encourages the TDWG community to come together and contribute to a common agenda for research and capacity building.","- Citizen science

NO,"Steatoda nobilis, a false widow on the rise: a synthesis of past and current distribution trends","The Noble False Widow, Steatoda nobilis (Thorell, 1875) (Araneae, Theridiidae), is, due to its relatively large size and potential medical importance, one of the most notable invasive spider species worldwide. Probably originating from the Canary Islands and Madeira, the species is well established in Western Europe and large parts of the Mediterranean area and has spread recently into California and South America, while Central European populations were not known until 2011.

We report on long-time observations that reveal that at least two flourishing populations in Germany (Cologne) have been present for over five years, while in Ecuador one population has been observed between 2014 and 2018 and several other records were made in other parts of the country. Data obtained from the British Spider Recording Scheme demonstrate that the species moved significantly northwards since the report of the first populations in the very South of England, after several decades of relative stasis. The sudden northward expansion highly correlates with a massive rise in press coverage of the species.

In the Americas, S. nobilis is currently known from four countries (USA, Chile, Ecuador, Colombia), and available DNA barcoding data obtained for specimens from this area suggest that multiple introductions occurred within each country. Using ecological niche modeling, we identified suitable climate regions for the species and discuss possible reasons for its current spread. We propose that seaside cities and villages with a temperate oceanic or Mediterranean climate are especially favourable potential habitats for S. nobilis and will face the highest colonization pressure in the future, while tropical upland regions with temperate climates are also vulnerable to invasion by S. nobilis.","- alien species

The participants were shown a brief tutorial, but were not given any clue. They were informed that they had to make decisions under different conditions and against different opponents. We made sure the interface be the most simple and understandable to ensure the correct understanding of the tasks. Also, the interface was the same for everybody. We made sure to avoid the research be upsetting or harmful for the participants by presenting the experiment as a game and playful activity. One researcher closely monitored each session to guarantee the experimental protocol be strictly followed. Yet, the researchers provided help when required. All participants in the experiment signed an informed consent to participate and no association was ever made between their real names and the results, in agreement with the Spanish Law for Personal Data Protection.

NO,Stirring the strategic direction of scuba diving marine Citizen Science: A survey of active and potential participants,"ABSTRACT

Citizen Science (CS) strengthens the relationship between society and science through education and engagement, with win-win benefits. Marine Citizen Science (MCS) is increasingly popular, thanks to society’s growing interest in marine environments and marine issues. Scuba diving significantly increases the potential of MCS, thanks to the skills and behavioural properties of people who participate in the sport. To be able to exploit this potential, however, MCS needs to face challenges related to CS, to scuba diving activities and to the broader scuba diving industry. In particular, engagement and recruitment of potential volunteers, as well as retention of active participants, represent key milestones. In order to reach these milestones, information is required on current participation levels of scuba divers in MCS, as well as the motivations behind participation, and the opinions held by potential participants in MCS. This study explored different case studies and methods of data collection to provide an overview of actual and potential participation in MCS by the scuba diving community. The results show that scuba divers, whether active or potential marine citizen scientists, are well disposed towards MCS. Some barriers, however, prevent the full participation of scuba divers as marine citizen scientists. Certain barriers extend beyond the control of both divers and MCS projects, while others, such as limited access to MCS projects and poor feedback after participation, can and should be addressed. The recommendations of this research provide strategic direction to MCS, so that the broad scuba diving community can be successfully integrated into MCS. These recommendations acknowledge the important role played by stakeholders in the scuba diving industry, as well as professional intermediaries and hired experts.","- Scientists

NO,Summary report and strategy recommendations for EU citizen science gateway for biodiversity data,"Citizen science is an approach of public participation in scientific research which has gained significant momentum in recent years. This is particularly evident in biology and environmental sciences where input from citizen scientists has greatly increased the number of publicly available observation data. However, there are still challenges in effective networking, data sharing and securing data quality. EU BON project has analyzed the citizen science landscape in Europe with regards to biodiversity research and proposes several policy recommendations. One of the recommendations is a Pan-European citizen science gateway for biodiversity data with dedicated tools for data collection and management. The prototypes of the gateway components are part of the EU BON biodiversity portal and described in current report.","- citizen science

,Sunspotter - 14 years of SoHO/MDI,"Second dataset based on automated detections produced by SMART [1] with data between May 1996 and August 2010 and classifications by volunteers through the zooniverse's Sunspotter project.
Volunteers had to choose the most complex active region of a pair based on a random selection of the least classified images. Unlike the first round [2], all active regions were scaled to have the same size. Attempting therefore to remove the bias produced by the differences on sizes.

The dataset is composed of five files:

lookup_timesfits.csv: lists the filenames and the date of the data acquisition.
lookup_properties.csv: lists the properties about the active region observed in each frame to be classified. Some of the properties as measured by SMART [1]
classifications.csv: lists each classification made by the volunteers.
rankings.csv: lists the final ranking on complexity.
users_links.csv: cross identifiers of users between dataset 2 (this one) and dataset 1 [2].

The score provided on the rankings file follows the Elo rating system. However, a new score following other selection mechanism is possible using the data available on the classification file.

Though the user's information has been removed, the classifications keep an index to differentiate classifications made by different users.

Some software to ingest the tables into a sqlite database and to obtain some preliminary results are available on GitHub.

NO,Testing the robustness of Citizen Science projects: Evaluating the results of pilot project COMBER,"Citizen Science (CS) as a term implies a great deal of approaches and scopes involving many different fields of science. The number of the relevant projects globally has been increased significantly in the recent years. Large scale ecological questions can be answered only through extended observation networks and CS projects can support this effort. Although the need of such projects is apparent, an important part of scientific community cast doubt on the reliability of CS data sets.

The pilot CS project COMBER has been created in order to provide evidence to answer the aforementioned question in the coastal marine biodiversity monitoring. The results of the current analysis show that a carefully designed CS project with clear hypotheses, wide participation and data sets validation, can be a valuable tool for the large scale and long term changes in marine biodiversity pattern change and therefore for relevant management and conservation issues.","- Coastal biodiversity

NO,"The ""biodiversity"" of communication and public engagement in ecology: activities and reflections from the LTER-Italy network","Socio-ecological research is conducted in national Long Term Ecosystem Research (LTER) networks worldwide, aiming at collecting and synthesizing both environmental and socio-economic data and to involve a broader stakeholder-community. The LTER networks therefore represent a suitable context where new and different forms of communication and of public participation and engagement could be experimented and where reflections about the way scientists communicate ecology can arose.

LTER-Italy realized, since 2015, the informal science communication initiative “Cammini LTER”, a series of trails connecting two or more LTER sites, where researches walked and cycled together with citizens, aiming at providing the public with the opportunity to get familiar with Italian ecosystems, from the sea to alpine tundra. During Cammini, LTER researchers experimented different forms of dialogue and of knowledge exchange with citizens, using a diversity of tools and language.

Here we present the most relevant examples of this “biodiversity” of communication and public engagement, analysing the key players, the context, the main results and criticisms. Alongside the classic forms of communication, aiming at informing the public about the LTER activities, others - more participative - were explored and developed: Citizen Science and Bioblitz, where knowledge and experiences are shared, the “Sea Futuring Tours”, partecipatory labs where communication became a chance of comparison among expert and non-expert perspectives and also the communication through social networks used in a non-conventional way.",,poster,Poster,,2018-11-28,10.5281/zenodo.1624930,1624930,10.5281/zenodo.1624931,1624931,"- Bergami, Caterina

NO,The Challenge of Evaluation: An Open Framework for Evaluating Citizen Science Activities,"In today’s knowledge-based society we are experiencing a rise in citizen science activities. Citizen science goals include enhancing scientific knowledge generation, contributing to societally relevant questions, fostering scientific literacy in society and transforming science communication. These aims, however, are rarely evaluated, and project managers as well as prospective funders are often at a loss when it comes to assessing and reviewing the quality and impact of citizen science activities. To ensure and improve the quality of citizen science outcomes evaluation methods are required for planning, self-evaluation and training development as well as for informing funding reviews and impact assessments. Here, based on an in-depth review of the characteristics and diversity of citizen science activities and current evaluation practices, we develop an open framework for evaluating diverse citizen science activities, ranging from projects initiated by grassroots initiatives to those led by academic scientists.  The framework incorporates the social, the scientific and the socio-ecological/economic perspectives of citizen science and thus offers a comprehensive collection of indicators at a glance. Indicators on a process- and impact-level can be selected and prioritized from all three perspectives, according to the specific contexts and targets. The framework guides and fosters the critical assessment and enhancement of citizen science projects against these goals both for external funding reviews as well as for internal project development.","- Citizen Science

NO,The economy of shark conservation: the role of eco-tourism and citizen science,"Historically sharks have been seen either as a source of income through harvesting, or as a nuisance and danger. The economic value of sharks has traditionally been measured as the total value of sharks caught for liver oil, fins, or meat for consumption. Sharks have also been killed to near extinction in cases where they were seen as a threat to fisheries on other species. This is illustrated by the mass extermination of Basking Sharks (Cetorhinus maximus) in British Columbia. They were seen as a nuisance to fishermen as they got entangled in gill nets during the salmon fishing season. However with the development of the SCUBA diving industry, and ecotourism in general, increased awareness of the role sharks play in marine ecosystems has resulted in changes in how they are perceived and utilized. Despite an ongoing harvest of sharks such as the North Pacific Spiny Dogfish (Squalus suckleyi), sharks now generate economic value through SCUBA diving enthusiasts who travel the globe to see, swim with, and photograph them. The use of digital cameras and other digital media has brought sharks into households around the world and increased awareness of the conservation issues facing many species. This renewed appreciation has led to a better understanding of sharks by the public, resulting in advocates calling for better protections and conservation. In particular, a growing part of the SCUBA diving community wants to contribute to conservation and research projects, which has led to participation in citizen science projects. These projects provide scientific data but also gain ground as ecotourism activities, thus adding to both economic value of tourism and conservation efforts.",- Shark conservation; Economic value; Shark tourism; Citizen science; Marine ecotourism,publication,Book section,section,2017-09-25,,995980,10.1016/bs.amb.2017.08.003,995981,"- Bear, Michael

NO,"The Global Garlic Mustard Field Survey (GGMFS): challenges and opportunities of a unique, large-scale collaboration for invasion biology","To understand what makes some species successful invaders, it is critical to quantify performance differences between native and introduced regions, and among populations occupying a broad range of environmental conditions within each region. However, these data are not available even for the world’s most notorious invasive species. Here we introduce the Global Garlic Mustard Field Survey, a coordinated distributed field survey to collect performance data and germplasm from a single invasive species: garlic mustard (Alliaria petiolata) across its entire distribution using minimal resources. We chose this species for its ecological impacts, prominence in ecological studies of invasion success, simple life history, and several genetic and life history attributes that make it amenable to experimental study. We developed a standardised field survey protocol to estimate population size (area) and density, age structure, plant size and fecundity, as well as damage by herbivores and pathogens in each population, and to collect representative seed samples. Across four years and with contributions from 164 academic and non-academic participants from 16 countries in North America and Europe thus far, we have collected 45,788 measurements and counts of 137,811 plants from 383 populations and seeds from over 5,000 plants. All field data and seed resources will be curated for release to the scientific community. Our goal is to establish A. petiolata as a model species for plant invasion biology and to encourage large collaborative studies of other invasive species.","- Alliaria petiolata

NO,The influence of motivational factors on the frequency of participation in citizen science activities,"Citizen science has become a mainstream approach to collect information and data on many different scientific subjects. In this study, we assess the effectiveness of engagement and meaningful experience of participants in citizen science projects. We use motivational measures calculated from a web survey where respondents answered questions regarding to their motivation to participate in BioDiversity4All, a Portuguese citizen science project. We adapted the intrinsic motivation inventory (IMI) and considered seven categories of measurement: Interest/Enjoyment, Perceived Competence, Effort/Importance, Perceived Choice, Value/Usefulness, Project Relatedness, and Group Relatedness each of them with statements rated on a seven-point Likert scale. We received 149 survey responses, corresponding to 10.3 % of BioDiversity4All Newsletter's receivers. We analyzed for possible differences among the categories pertaining to gender, age, level of education and level of participation in the project. Finally, we assessed the different patterns of motivation existing among the users. No statistical differences were found between genders, age classes and levels of education for the averages in any category of analysis. However, IMI categories presented different results for respondents with different levels of participation. The highest value of Interest/Enjoyment and Perceived Competence was obtained by the group of respondents that participate a lot and the lowest by the ones that never participated. Project Relatedness had the highest value for all groups except for the group that never participated. This group had completely different motivations from the other groups, showing the lowest levels in categories such as Perceived Competence, Value/Usefulness, Project Relatedness and Group Relatedness. In conclusion, the results from our work show that working deeply on people's involvement is fundamental to increase and maintain their participation on citizen science projects. If, for initial recruitment and in countries with low participation culture, mechanisms of external motivation may be necessary, to guarantee higher levels of long term participation, citizen science projects should foster intrinsic motivations which can be done by incorporating in project design experiences of relatedness, capacity building, positive feedback and adapted participation modes.","- Citizen Science

NO,"The LIFE Project ""Monitoring of insects with public participation"" (MIPP): aims, methods and conclusions","The Life Project ""Monitoring of insects with public participation"" (LIFE11 NAT/IT/000252) had as the main objective to develop and test methods for the monitoring of five beetle species listed in the Annexes of the Habitats Directive (92/43/EEC): Osmoderma eremita (hermit beetle, Scarabaeidae), Lucanus cervus (European stag beetle, Lucanidae), Cerambyx cerdo (great capricorn beetle, Cerambycidae), Rosalia alpina (rosalia longicorn, Cerambycidae) and Morimus asper/funereus (morimus longicorn, Cerambycidae). The data gathered represent an important contribution to the monitoring of these target species in Italy. The methods developed for monitoring of the target species are intended for use by the local management authorities and staff of protected areas. These developed methods are the result of extensive fieldwork and ensure scientific validity, ease of execution and limited labour costs. The detailed description of methods and the results for each species are published in separate articles of this special issue of Nature Conservation. A second objective of the project was to gather faunistic data with a Citizen Science approach, using the web and a mobile application software (app) specifically built for mobile devices. The validation of the records collected by the citizens was carried out by experts, based on photographs, which were obligatory for all records. Dissemination activities represented the principal way to contact and engage citizens for the data collection and also offered the possibility of providing information on topics such as Natura 2000, the Habitats Directive, the role of monitoring in nature conservation, the importance of forest ecosystems and the ecological role of the saproxylic insects. An innovative method tested during the project was the training of a dog for searching and monitoring the elusive hermit beetle; the trained dog also added a ""curiosity"" factor to attract public attention towards this rare insect and the issues mentioned above.","- Saproxylic beetle monitoring

NO,The need for an integrated biodiversity policy support process – Building the European contribution to a global Biodiversity Observation Network (EU BON),"Biodiversity is threatened on a global scale and the losses are ongoing. In order to stop further losses and maintain important ecosystem services, programmes have been put into place to reduce and ideally halt these processes. A whole suite of different approaches is needed to meet these goals. One major scientific contribution is to collate, integrate and analyse the large amounts of fragmented and diverse biodiversity data to determine the current status and trends of biodiversity in order to inform the relevant decision makers. To contribute towards the achievement of these challenging tasks, the project EU BON was developed. The project is focusing mainly on the European continent but contributes at the same time to a much wider global initiative the Group on Earth Observations Biodiversity Observation Network (GEO BON), which itself is a part of the Group of Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS). EU BON will build on existing infrastructures such as GBIF, LifeWatch and national biodiversity data centres in Europe and will integrate relevant biodiversity data from on-ground observations to remote sensing information, covering terrestrial, freshwater and marine habitats.

A key feature of EU BON will be the delivery of relevant, fully integrated data to multiple and different stakeholders and end users ranging from local to global levels. Through development and application of new standards and protocols, EU BON will enable greater interoperability of different data layers and systems, provide access to improved analytical tools and services, and will provide better harmonized biodiversity recording and monitoring schemes from citizen science efforts to long-term research programs to mainstream future data collecting. Furthermore EU BON will support biodiversity science-policy interfaces, and facilitate political decisions for sound environmental management, also to help conserve biodiversity for human well-being at different levels, ranging from communal park management to the Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES). Additionally, the project will strengthen European capacities and infrastructures for environmental information management and sustainable development.

NO,The notes from nature tool for unlocking biodiversity records from museum records through citizen science,"Legacy data from natural history collections contain invaluable and irreplaceable information about biodiversity in the recent past, providing a baseline for detecting change and forecasting the future of biodiversity on a human-dominated planet. However, these data are often not available in formats that facilitate use and synthesis. New approaches are needed to enhance the rates of digitization and data quality improvement. Notes from Nature provides one such novel approach by asking citizen scientists to help with transcription tasks. The initial web-based prototype of Notes from Nature is soon widely available and was developed collaboratively by biodiversity scientists, natural history collections staff, and experts in citizen science project development, programming and visualization. This project brings together digital images representing different types of biodiversity records including ledgers , herbarium sheets and pinned insects from multiple projects and natural history collections. Experts in developing web-based citizen science applications then designed and built a platform for transcribing textual data and metadata from these images. The end product is a fully open source web transcription tool built using the latest web technologies. The platform keeps volunteers engaged by initially explaining the scientific importance of the work via a short orientation, and then providing transcription “missions” of well defined scope, along with dynamic feedback, interactivity and rewards. Transcribed records, along with record-level and process metadata, are provided back to the institutions. While the tool is being developed with new users in mind, it can serve a broad range of needs from novice to trained museum specialist. Notes from Nature has the potential to speed the rate of biodiversity data being made available to a broad community of users.","- Natural History Museums

,The PIRATE: an anthropometric earPlug with exchangeable microphones for Individual Reliable Acquisition of Transfer functions at the Ear canal entrance,"We present the open design of the PIRATE, an anthropometric earPlug with exchangable microphones for Individual Reliable Acquisition of Transfer functions at the Ear canal entrance. Its outer shape is available in 5 sizes and provides a deep, tight and reproducible fit in virtually all human ears. The design includes a recess to accommodate a MEMS microphone. Thus, the same microphone can be conveniently used in different earplugs without losing accuracy, and the microphone can be removed for calibration. The PIRATE or previous versions of it have been utilized in several studies with more than 200 subjects

From the provided model, the earplugs can be 3D printed, and only minor working steps are necessary before use. These steps are described in the documentation.

,The Quest for Natural Machine Motion: An Open Platform to Fast-Prototyping Articulated Soft Robots,"Soft robots are one of the most significant recent evolutions in robotics. They rely on compliant physical structures purposefully designed to embody desired characteristics. Since their introduction, they have shown remarkable applicability in overcoming their rigid counterparts in such areas as interaction with humans, adaptability, energy efficiency, and maximization of peak performance. Nonetheless, we believe that research on novel soft robot applications is still slowed by the difficulty in obtaining or developing a working soft robot structure to explore novel applications. In this article, we present the Natural Machine Motion Initiative (NMMI), a modular open platform that aims to provide the scientific community with tools for fast and easy prototyping of articulated soft robots. Such a platform is composed of three main open hardware modules: the Qbmoves variable-stiffness actuators (VSAs) to build the main robotic structure, soft end effectors (EEs) to interact with the world, and a pool of application-specific add-ons. We also discuss many novel uses of the platform to rapidly prototype (RP) and test new robotic structures with original soft capabilities, and we propose NMMI-based experiments.","- Actuators, Soft robotics, Robots, Hardware, Service robots, Machine motion, Motion control",publication,Journal article,article,2017-02-16,,1037470,10.1109/MRA.2016.2636366,1037471,"- Della Santina Cosimo

,The Quest for New Empowered Citizen Scientists,"Citizen science is well-known as being a very efficient means collecting large amounts of data at a global scale. However, even if it seems nice to collect observations about flowering plants and singing birds, people living in today's world need to understand this global biodiversity crisis is here to stay. We need to move past the human sensor paradigm and learn to incorporate the general public in the entire research process. We need to move from cheap data labour to truly empowered citizen scientists and realise that stakeholders may not have complex scientific questions but still have questions about their environment. We need to move from citizen science to participatory science (Hinckson et al. 2017,Katapally 2019,Poncet and Turcati 2017), if we want to tackle the challenges we will be facing in the coming years.

Natural Solutions has developed a number of gamified citizen science applications in the past (ecoBalade, Biolit, Sauvage de ma rue, INPN espèces, GeoNature Citizen), through which we have gained a good understanding of what works. Our last project is to create a citizen acting mobile platform using cognitive bias to nudge citizen in acting toward biodiversity. The application will be part of the IUCN congress taking part in Marseille in 2020.","- citizen science

,The Role of Natural History Collections in Public Engagement for Enhancing Biodiversity Research,"Citizen science biodiversity monitoring projects are becoming very common. It is generally accepted that these joint projects, of scientists and the public, have a positive effect on biodiversity and conservation education programs as well as on policy-makers opinion Ganzevoort et al. (2017). Yet, there is still a debate on the quality of the data collected in citizen science monitoring schemes, and especially on the benefits to high-quality research. Here, I present an example of how collection-based research and involvement of the public (non-taxonomists) in taxonomical education, i.e., advanced citizen science, can enhance research on scorpion diversity in Israel. Furthermore, the process of public involvement in monitoring and especially the prerequisites needed for this process, contributed to high-quality research, that in turn is enhancing biodiversity science. Considering this, I will discuss the basic stages required for successful public engagement in high-quality biodiversity research and monitoring schemes.","- citizen science

,The Social Mission of 21st Century Research Libraries: Building Data Literate Communities,"The datafication of research, higher education, and society has made data literacy a key requirement for academic and professional success. It is also a prerequisite for successful participation in citizen science, open government, community development, smart healthcare, and social networks. The data revolution has similarly penetrated all areas of frontline and backroom work in libraries and turned research libraries into data-intensive organizations as a result of developments in digital scholarship, bibliometrics and altmetrics, open science, linked open data, learning analytics and data-based decision making. All library workers will increasingly need at least basic competence in dealing with data to contribute effectively in the research library of the future.

Many research libraries have responded to the data challenge by evolving their data literacy support from helping students and faculty to find and use external social data sets to advising on management and sharing of original research data in the context of funder requirements for data management plans. A few libraries have extended the depth and breadth of their data literacy support to cover other areas and involve more library staff via data literacy training. However, our study suggests more radical change in data literacy practice is needed for research libraries to support their communities effectively in the connected data society of the 21st century.

Our research is based on a comprehensive investigation of the impact of data on society and understandings of data literacy among different disciplines, professions, and institutions. We also explored approaches to data literacy education, including information literacy and digital skills practices that could be adopted or adapted to develop data literacy. We supplemented evidence from a variety of literature (research papers, academic textbooks, professional manuals, agency publications, popular treatments, and industry newsletters), with data from project databases and organization websites to capture current thinking and emergent practice in this fast-moving field.

We found significant variation in how different groups and sectors define and position data literacy, which has implications for the scope and focus of library data literacy interventions. We also identified a range of stakeholders as potential collaborators for research libraries in advancing data literacy locally and globally. In addition, we found evidence of research librarians acknowledging responsibility to ensure all staff and students have the digital skills required to be successful in scholarship, employment, and lifelong learning; and another example where librarians successfully delivered an information literacy course helping students to handle information from multiple life perspectives, supporting their information needs across their academic, professional, and personal lives.

We conclude first, that data literacy is an essential competence for all members of society; second, that existing models of data literacy education need to be extended to reflect alternative conceptions of data literacy and cover settings where people interact with data in their personal and social lives; and third, that research libraries are uniquely placed to lead the development of data literacy in society, by virtue of their expertise, structure, and relationships, but should collaborate with salient stakeholders to develop a more diverse and inclusive approach.",,presentation,Presentation,,2019-06-28,10.5281/zenodo.3259728,3259728,10.5281/zenodo.3259729,3259729,"- Corrall, Sheila Mary",
NO,The state of the data in citizen science,"Citizen science has contributed to biodiversity research and monitoring for hundreds of years. Still, the recent increase in scale, scope, diversity and number of citizen science projects highlights the challenge of designing and implementing good practices around data collection and data curation. The Committee on Data for Science and Technology of the International Council for Science (ICSU-CODATA) and the World Data System (WDS) recently founded a joint Task Group to understand and support good practices for citizen science data validation, data cleaning and curation, and, short- and long- term data management.

Research projects conducted by the ICSU-CODATA-WDS Task Group include the development of an initial typology of citizen science data generating tasks, and an exploratory landscape analysis of the state of the data in citizen science. The landscape analysis found that citizen science projects use a wide range of strategies for data validation at numerous stages of the scientific research process. In comparison, practices for data documentation, curation, and long-term management are less advanced. This may limit data discovery and re-use.

This work compliments the planned and ongoing efforts of the TDWG Citizen Science Interest Group to advance biodiversity informatics for citizen science. Presenting research on the state of the data in citizen science can promote cross-pollination between the ICSU-CODATA-WDS Task Group and the biodiversity community, and encourage researchers and practitioners to work together to advance citizen science data quality, standards, and interoperability.","- Citizen science

NO,The Swedish Taxonomy Initative & Biodiversity Infrastructure,"The Swedish Species Information Centre (ArtDatabanken, SSIC) at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU) accumulates, analyses and disseminates information concerning Swedish species, habitats and ecosystems. The SSIC hosts the Swedish Taxonomy Initiative (STI) and produces the Swedish Red List. In addition, the SSIC is the leading partner within the Swedish LifeWatch (SLW) consortium, which cooperates with the Biodiversity Atlas Sweden (BAS) and the Living Atlas Community.

The SSIC provides an open access biodiversity reporting and analysis infrastructure including for example the Swedish Species Observation System (artportalen.se), the Swedish taxonomic backbone (dyntaxa.se) and tools for species information including traits, terminology and species determination (artfakta.se). All systems, including the SLW Analysis Portal (analysisportal.se), rely on recognized standards to ensure interoperability and consist of databases, API:s and portals. The Artportalen platform now contains >69 000 000 georeferenced observations, along with 1 300 000 images, video or sound, of some 32 000 species from Sweden. The data are harvested by SLW and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). In addition to reports from NGOs and the general public, which generate >90% of the observations, a rapidly increasing number of Swedish governmental authorities and agencies are using the platform to store regional and local species inventories collected by standardized scientific methods. There are sophisticated systems for validation and to secure data quality, and the records are used by scientists as well as by county and municipality councils as a principle biodiversity resource in environmental planning and decision making. Data concerning some species considered to be particularly sensitive to disturbance are classified and not openly available. These data can be accessed via a hierarchy of access levels so as to enable such classified data to available to, for example, environmental officers and to be used in management purposes The SSIC has just launched new API:s, modules for improved reporting of species checklists and invasive species, and a new platform aggregating the services in a single web interface and based on responsive design and specific interfaces for different users (artfakta.se). Improvements are also to be made in the infrastructure of the Swedish taxonomic backbone, which now contains data for almost all Swedish species (more than 275 000 scientific names and 62 000 species).

In 2002, when the Swedish Taxonomy Initiative (STI) was established, the SSIC was commissioned by the Swedish Parliament to identify all species of multicellular plants, fungi and animals in the country and to make the information available to scientists, conservationists and the public. The information is presented in the Artfakta platform and in a series of identification handbooks, The Encyclopedia of the Swedish Flora and Fauna. In addition, the STI supports barcoding activities, scientific courses and announces grants for museums and taxonomic research and inventories within poorly known organismal groups. The Swedish and Norwegian taxonomy initiatives work cooperatively to increase the collective knowledge of poorly known species and, as a result, more than 3 000 species new to Sweden and Norway have been found, approximately a third being new to science. The attempt to join forces between different Scandinavian counterparts via technical progress and to focus on digitalization and sharing information on species and communities from the same biogeographical region has proven a successful concept.","- Biodiversity infrastructure

NO,The Treasure of George Vernon Hudson,"George V. Hudson, born 1867 in London, developed a strong interest in nature when he was nine years old and began collecting insects. At the age of 13 he wrote and illustrated his first manuscript on insects.

In 1881 Hudson moved to New Zealand, where he worked as a clerk in the post office in Wellington until his retirement in 1919. However, he kept collecting, investigating and describing insects in his spare time, and was determined to present New Zealand's insect fauna to the general public. He was critical of the formal education system and provided alternative methods of learning through his books. His achievements place him among New Zealand's distinguished pioneer naturalists.

After Hudson's death in April 1946, his collection of insects, one of the largest and most valuable private collection in New Zealand, was donated to the Dominion Museum with the condition that it remained intact in its nine original cabinets. These are made from kauri and are full of neatly pinned in sects, Hudson invented his own coding system for labelling his specimens. The numbers that refer to each specimen were recorded in three volumes of register books, where he noted details about the samples. These registers are the only way we can understand the collection. However, since Hudson had a very idiosyncratic handwriting and wrote between lines when he ran out of space, his registers are very hard to read. Also, he changed names, deleted numbers of specimens that were given away and reused those numbers. In short, these registers were living documents that changed with the collection.

This collection is of immense scientific value and it has been well protected in climate-controlled conditions, although quite inaccessible for many years. Now, the kauri cabinets are secured to shelving units bolted to the floor and a wall. This provides protection against flooding and earthquake hazards. The registers and the specimens in the drawers are part of a digitisation program. All the information on the aging register pages were scanned in high resolution. It is now possible to magnify the writing and transfer the data into a database without touching the vulnerable originals. It is also possible to share the scanned pages with volunteers and experts, who can help deciphering Hudson's notes. The plan is to make some of the pages available online, as part of a citizen science project.","- Collection access and use

NO,The USA National Phenology Network: A Framework for Delivery of Phenology Data Products on Multiple Spatiotemporal Scales,"The USA National Phenology Network (USA-NPN; www.usanpn.org) serves science and society by promoting a broad understanding of plant and animal phenology and the relationships among phenological patterns, climate, and environmental change. Data collected by citizen and professional scientists through Nature's Notebook – a national- scale, multi-taxa phenology observation program – serve USA-NPN's strategic goals of advancing science and informing decisions. The National Phenology Database currently houses over 10 million phenology observation records; these data are being used in a rapidly growing number of applications for science, conservation and resource management.  In addition, the USA-NPN produces and freely delivers maps of  both historic and contemporary, short-term forecasts of accumulated growing degree days and spring onset dates (based on the Extended Spring Indices) at fine spatial scale for the conterminous United States. These data products have utility for a wide range of natural resource planning and management applications, including scheduling invasive species and pest detection and control activities, determining planting dates, anticipating allergy outbreaks and planning agricultural harvest dates.

Accumulated growing degree day (AGDD) maps are produced because accumulated temperature is a strong driver of phenological transitions in plants and animals, including leaf-out, flowering, fruit ripening and migration. The Extended Spring Indices (SI-x) are based on predictive climate models for lilac and honeysuckle leaf and bloom which have been widely used to summarize the changes in the timing of spring onset, and have been chosen as national indicators of climate change impacts by the US Global Change Research Program and the Environmental Protection Agency.

Web services are available for both in-situ and geospatial data, and the USA-NPN is currently involved in multiple efforts to support the integration of phenology datasets. In this presentation, we will present an overview of the current status of USA-NPN phenology data products, data delivery tools, and explore the methods and possibilities of integrating USA-NPN data with outside datasets.","- phenology in-situ geospatial USA-NPN ""National Phenology Network"" ""web services"" ""AGDD"" ""Spring Index"" ""citizen science""",publication,Journal article,article,2017-08-11,,1140463,10.3897/tdwgproceedings.1.20188,1140464,"- Marsh, Lee",
NO,The use of avian museum specimen data in phenology studies: prospects and challenges,"Museum specimens offer a rich source of data on both long-term averages and temporal trends in organismal phenology. To date much of this work has focused on plants, but animal specimens are also useful in this regard. In particular, bird specimens may include data on age, gonad size and development, and molt, all of which are relevant to estimating breeding phenology. In addition, bird collections include nests and eggs, which are direct records of breeding. These data are some of the richest available for any vertebrate group, and the potential for integration with citizen-science-based data (e.g. eBird) is extremely promising. However, there are a number of challenges associated with use of these data, including biased geographic sampling, incomplete digitization, and non-uniform data standards, that currently limit their utility. In addition, methods for analysis of these data have not been well developed. Here, we outline informatics challenges associated with developing a database of avian gonad size data. In addition, we present a novel analytical framework for estimating phenology from such data (Fig. 1) that is broadly applicable to seasonal phenotype measurements.","- phenology

,TICJ: An Application to Generate Transcendental Information Cascades,"Transcendental Information Cascades are a model based grounded on the assumption that there are meaningful relationships to be found in coincidence. With this research seeks to lay out foundations for a general theory of coincidence in information spaces, expanding on existing work on bursty structures in document streams and information cascades. Transcendental Information Cascades suit to represent the complexity of an information system by means of a static network that incorporates time and enable a novel way to quantify information diversity and information specificity. This has been proven useful to capture communication patterns in citizen science as well as hidden temporal structures in Wikipedia edit activity. Recent debates about our increasingly selective view to information - a result of content personalisation in search results and social network timelines due to the commercial interest of the social network providers - are a strong motivation for this kind of data analyses and information retrieval systems, which aim at avoiding the amplification of biases that lie in digital social structures (e.g. gender imbalances but also deliberate spread of misinformation).

,To bee or not to bee: An annotated dataset for beehive sound recognition,"-- Dataset documentation --


1- Introduction

The present dataset was developed in the context of our work in [1] that focus on the automatic recognition of beehive sounds. The problem is posed as the classification of sound segments in two classes: Bee and noBee. The novelty of the explored approach and the need for annotated data, dictated the construction of such dataset.

2- Description

2.1- Audio recordings:

The annotated dataset was developed based on a selected set of recordings acquired in the context of two different projects: the Open Source Beehive (OSBH) project [2] and the NU-Hive project [3]. Both projects main goal is to develop a beehive monitoring system capable of identifying and predict certain events and states of the hive that are of interest to the beekeeper. Among many different variables that can be measured and that help the recognition of different states of the hive, the analysis and use of the sound the bees produce is a big focus for both projects.

The recordings from the OSBH project were acquired through a citizen science initiative which asked people from the general public to record the sound from their beehives together with the registering of the hive state at the moment. Because of the amateur and collaborative nature of this project, the recordings from the OSBH project present great diversity due to the very different conditions in which the signals were acquired: different recording devices used, different environments where the hives were placed, and even different position for the microphones inside the hive. This variety of settings makes this dataset a very interesting tool to help evaluate and challenge the methods developed.

The NU-Hive project is a comprehensive effort of data acquisition, concerning not only sound, but a vast amount of variables that will allow the study of bees behaviors and other unknown aspects. The selected recordings are taken from 2 hives and labeled regarding two states: queen bee is present, and queen bee not present. Contrary to the OSBH project recordings, the recordings from the NU-Hive project are from a much more controlled and homogeneous environment. Here the occurring external sounds are mainly traffic, car honks and birds.

The annotated dataset:

For each selected recording, time segments are labeled as Bee or noBee depending on the perceived source of the sound signal being from bees or external to the hive.

The whole annotated dataset consists of 78 recordings of varying lengths which make up for a total duration of approximately 12 hours of which 25% is annotated as noBee events.

About 60% of the recordings are from the NU-Hive dataset and represent 2 hives, the remaining are recordings from the OSBH dataset and 6 different hives. The recorded hives are from 3 main locations: North America, Australia and Europe.

 

2- Annotation procedure¶

The annotation procedure consists in hearing the selected recordings and marking the beginning and the end of every sound that could not be recognized as a beehive sound. The recognition of external sounds is based primarily on the perceived heard sounds, but a visual aid is also used by visualizing the log-mel frequency spectrum of the signal. All the above are functionalities offered by the Sonic Visualiser software, which was used by two volunteers that are neither bee-specialists nor specially trained in sound annotation tasks.

By marking these pairs of moments corresponding to the beginning and end of external sound periods, we are able to get the whole recording labeled into Bee and noBee intervals. Thus in the resulting Bee intervals only pure beehive sounds, (no external sounds) should be perceived for the entirety of the segment. The noBee intervals refer to periods where an external sound can be perceived (superimposed to the bee sounds).

 

File Structure:

Each audio file is coupled with its corresponding annotation file, identified by the same name and extension .lab.
For convenience, all the annotations are collected in a single master label file named beeAnnotations.mlf

The .lab files consist of : 

First row identifies the audio file to which the annotations refer to.
Each line after that describes an interval with starting time point, end time point and label. The time points are expressed in seconds.

Below is an example of such an annotation file: 

Hive3_20_07_2017_QueenBee_H3_audio_15_30_00
0 78.45 bee
78.46 78.95 nobee

NO,Towards a crowdsourced supervision of the analysis of user-generated geographic content: Engaging citizens in discovering urban places,"This paper presents a conceptual model and a proof-of-concept implementation of a novel approach to engage citizens in supervising the analysis of user-generated geographic content (UGGC). For example, UGGC allows insights into the (re-) production of urban spaces, promising new options for pro-active urban planning, citizen participation, and local empowerment. However, the unknown quality and high volume of UGGC require advanced filtering and classification procedures to be able to extract new knowledge and actionable intelligence. The complexity of some tasks and the increasing volume of UGGC often restrict the role of citizens to data providers. We argue that citizen should and can play a decisive role in the parameterization and training of deeper computational analysis of UGGC streams. The challenge is how to present geographical analysis problems to a crowd of human supervisors, and how to elicit responses and feed those back into the workflow. We propose a hybrid processing approach, which maps geographical problems into data mining and machine-learning tasks, presents analysis results to human supervisors, and uses the responses to improve the machine-learning and data mining. For the pilot study, we adapt an approach to find semantically distinct places in UGGC. The human supervisors rate the clustering of potentially similar geo-located photographs from the platform Flickr, and thereby help parametrize both the data mining of geospatial clusters, as well as the classification of similar images based on several ancillary attributes.","- crowdsourcing

NO,Towards an annual species distribution EBV for the United Kingdom,"A coherent framework for building Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBVs) is now emerging, but there are few examples of EBVs being produced at large extents. I describe the creation of a species distribution EBV for the United Kingdom, covering 5293 species from 1970-2015. The data product contains an annual occupancy estimate for every species in each year, each with a measure of uncertainty. I will describe the workflow to produce this data product. The data collation step bring togehter different sources of occurrence records; the data standardisation step harmonizes these records to a common spatio-temporal resolution. These data are then converted into a set of 'detection histories' for each species within each taxonomic group, before being passed to the occupancy-detection model. Outputs from this model are then summarised as 1000 samples from the postierior distribution of occupancy estimates for each species:year combination. I will also describe the infrastructure requirements to create the EBV and to update it annually. This endeavour has been made possible because the vast majority of the 34 million species records have been collated and curated by 31 taxon-oriented citizen science groups. I go on to describe the challenges of harmonizing and integrating these occurrence records with other data types, such as from systematic surveys, including count data. Such ""integrated models"" are statisitcally challenging, but now within reach, thanks to the development of new tools that make it possible to conceive of modelling everything, everywhere. However, a substantial and concerted effort is required to curate biodiversity data in a way that maximises their potential for the next generation of models, and for truly global EBVs.","- EBV

NO,Towards the reproducibility in soil erosion modeling: a new Pan-European soil erosion map,"Abstract
Soil erosion by water is a widespread phenomenon throughout Europe and has the potentiality, with his on-site and off-site effects, to affect water quality, food security and floods. Despite the implementation of numerous and different models for estimating soil erosion by water in Europe, there is still a lack of harmonization of assessment methodologies.
Often, different approaches result in soil erosion rates significantly different. Even when the same model is applied to the same region the results may differ. This can be due to the way the model is implemented (i.e. with the selection of different algorithms when available) and/or to the use of datasets having different resolution or accuracy. Scientific computation is emerging as one of the central topic of the scientific method, for overcoming these problems there is thus the necessity to develop reproducible computational method where codes and data are available.
The present study illustrates this approach. Using only public available datasets, we applied the Revised Universal Soil loss Equation (RUSLE) to locate the most sensitive areas to soil erosion by water in Europe.
A significant effort was made for selecting the better simplified equations to be used when a strict application of the RUSLE model is not possible. In particular for the computation of the Rainfall Erosivity factor (R) the reproducible research paradigm was applied. The calculation of the R factor was implemented using public datasets and the GNU R language. An easily reproducible validation procedure based on measured precipitation time series was applied using MATLAB language. Designing the computational modelling architecture with the aim to ease as much as possible the future reuse of the model in analysing climate change scenarios is also a challenging goal of the research.

NO,Tracking Invasive Alien Species (TrIAS): Building a data-driven framework to inform policy,"Imagine a future where dynamically, from year to year, we can track the progression of alien species (AS), identify emerging problem species, assess their current and future risk and timely inform policy in a seamless data-driven workflow. One that is built on open science and open data infrastructures. By using international biodiversity standards and facilities, we would ensure interoperability, repeatability and sustainability. This would make the process adaptable to future requirements in an evolving AS policy landscape both locally and internationally. In recent years, Belgium has developed decision support tools to inform invasive alien species (IAS) policy, including information systems, early warning initiatives and risk assessment protocols. However, the current workflows from biodiversity observations to IAS science and policy are slow, not easily repeatable, and their scope is often taxonomically, spatially and temporally limited. This is mainly caused by the diversity of actors involved and the closed, fragmented nature of the sources of these biodiversity data, which leads to considerable knowledge gaps for IAS research and policy. We will leverage expertise and knowledge from nine former and current BELSPO projects and initiatives: Alien Alert, Invaxen, Diars, INPLANBEL, Alien Impact, Ensis, CORDEX.be, Speedy and the Belgian Biodiversity Platform. The project will be built on two components: 1) The establishment of a data mobilization framework for AS data from diverse data sources and 2) the development of data-driven procedures for risk evaluation based on risk modelling, risk mapping and risk assessment. We will use facilities from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), standards from the Biodiversity Information Standards organization (TDWG) and expertise from Lifewatch to create and facilitate a systematic workflow. Alien species data will be gathered from a large set of regional, national and international initiatives, including citizen science with a wide taxonomic scope from marine, terrestrial and freshwater environments. Observation data will be funnelled in repeatable ways to GBIF. In parallel, a Belgian checklist of AS will be established, benefiting from various taxonomic and project-based checklists foreseen for GBIF publication. The combination of the observation data and the checklist will feed indicators for the identification of emerging species; their level of invasion in Belgium; changes in their invasion status and the identification of areas and species of concern that could be impacted upon by bioinvasions. Data-driven risk evaluation of identified emerging species will be supported by niche and climate modelling and consequent risk mapping using critical climatic variables for the current and projected future climate periods at high resolution. The resulting risk maps will complement risk assessments performed with the recently developed Harmonia+ protocol to assess risks posed by emergent species to biodiversity and human, plant, and animal health. The use of open data will ensure that interested stakeholders in Belgium and abroad can make use of the information we generate. The open science ensures everyone is free to adopt and adapt the workflow for different scenarios and regions. The checklist will be used at national level, but will also serve as the Belgian reference for international databases (IUCN - GRIIS, EASIN) and impact assessments (IPBES, SEBI). The workflow will be showcased through GEO BON, the Invasivesnet network and the COST Actions Alien Challenge and ParrotNet. The observations and outcomes of risk evaluations will be used to provide science-based support for the implementation of IAS policies at the regional, federal and EU levels. The publication of Belgian data and checklists on IAS is particularly timely in light of the currently ongoing EU IAS Regulation and its implementation in Belgium. By proving that automated workflows can provide rapid and repeatable production of information, we will open up this technology for other conservation assessments.",- Information Technology; Risk Evaluation; Evidence-Based Policy; Open Data Publication; Climate Change,publication,Journal article,article,2017-05-02,,780768,10.3897/rio.3.e13414,575862,"- Vanderhoeven, Sonia

NO,Training Machines to Identify Species using GBIF-mediated Datasets,"Advances in machine vision technology are rapidly enabling new and innovative uses within the field of biodiversity. Computers are now able to use images to identify tens of thousands of species across a wide range of taxonomic groups in real time, notably demonstrated by iNaturalist.org, which suggests species IDs to users (https://www.inaturalist.org/pages/computer_vision_demo) as they create observation records. Soon it will be commonplace to detect species in video feeds or use the camera in a mobile device to search for species-related content on the Internet.

The Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) has an important role to play in advancing and improving this technology, whether in terms of data, collaboration across teams, or citation practice. But in the short term, the most important role may relate to initiating a cultural shift in accepted practices for the use of GBIF-mediated data for training of artificial intelligence (AI).

""Training datasets"" play a critical role in achieving species recognition capability in any machine vision system. These datasets compile representative images containing the explicit, verifiable identifications of the species they include. High-powered computers run algorithms on these training datasets, analysing the imagery and building complex models that characterize defining features for each species or taxonomic group. Researchers can, in turn, apply the resulting models to new images, determining what species or group they likely contain. Current research in machine vision is exploring (a) the use of location and date information to further improve model results, (b) identification methods beyond species-level into attribute, character, trait, or part-level ID, with an eye toward human interpretability, and (c) expertise modeling for improved determination of ""research grade"" images and metadata.

The GBIF community has amassed one of the largest datasets of labelled species images available on the internet: more than 33 million species occurrence records in GBIF.org have one or more images (https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/gallery). Machine vision models, when integrated into the data collection tools in use across the GBIF network, can improve the user experience. For example, in citizen science applications like iNaturalist, automated species suggestion helps even novice users contribute occurrence records to GBIF.

Perhaps most importantly, GBIF has implemented uniform (and open) data licensing, established guidelines on citation and provided consistent methods for tracking data use through the Digital Object Identifiers (DOI) citation chain. GBIF would like to build on the lessons learned in these activities while striving to assist with this technology research and increase its power and availability.

We envisage an approach as follows:

To assist in developing and refining machine vision models, GBIF plans to provide training datasets, taking effort to ensure license and citation practice are respected. The training datasets will be issued with a DOI, and the contributing datasets will be linked through the DOI citation graph.

To assist application developers, Google and Visipedia plan to build and publish openly-licensed models and tutorials for how to adapt them for localized use.

Together we will strive to ensure that data is being used responsibly and transparently, to close the gap between machine vision scientists, application developers, and users and to share taxonomic trees capturing the taxon rank to which machine vision models can identify with confidence based on an image's visual characteristics.","- biodiversity species

NO,"TrIAS, leveraging citizen science data to monitor invasive species in Belgium","Reducing the damage caused by invasive species requires a community approach informed by rapidly mobilized data. Even if local stakeholders work together, invasive species do not respect borders, and national, continental and global policies are required. Yet, in general, data on invasive species are slow to be mobilized, often of insufficient quality for their intended application and distributed among many stakeholders and their organizations, including scientists, land managers, and citizen scientists. The Belgian situation is typical. We struggle with the fragmentation of data sources and restrictions to data mobility. Nevertheless, there is a common view that the issue of invasive alien species needs to be addressed. In 2017 we launched the Tracking Invasive Alien Species (TrIAS) project, which envisages a future where alien species data are rapidly mobilized, the spread of exotic species is regularly monitored, and potential impacts and risks are rapidly evaluated in support of policy decisions (Vanderhoeven et al. 2017). TrIAS is building a seamless, data-driven workflow, from raw data to policy support documentation. TrIAS brings together 21 different stakeholder organizations that covering all organisms in the terrestrial, freshwater and marine environments. These organizations also include those involved in citizen science, research and wildlife management.

TrIAS is an Open Science project and all the software, data and documentation are being shared openly (Groom et al. 2018). This means that the workflow can be reused as a whole or in part, either after the project or in different countries. We hope to prove that rapid data workflows are not only an indispensable tool in the control of invasive species, but also for integrating and motivating the citizens and organizations involved.","- workflow

NO,Turning Flickr into a useful Citizen Science Resource,"Flickr is a photo and web hosting social media site created by Ludicorp in 2004 and later (in 2005) acquired by Yahoo. It is largely used by people for hosting social media type photos, but through the judicious use of Tagging (including use of machine tags), APIs, grouping, tag indexing and georeferencing it has been turned into a powerful citizen science resource.

By 2015, it was estimated that there were over 10 billion images on Flickr, and there are millions of biodiversity-related images posted. Flickr provides for the creation of 'Groups' and for example, the 'Bird Photo Group' alone has over 2.7 million photographs. Of course, not all biodiversity images are named and identified, or georeferenced (although many are), but many of the Flickr Groups have established rules that allow easy identification of images with names, through tagging and machine tagging. Flickr also includes an in-house georeferencing tool, and georeferences can also be added through machine-tagging.

Data Quality is always an issue with any Citizen Science initiative, and identification from images can often be problematic. Many Flickr Groups, however, have scientists as members and these will often interact with the photographer to help identify species. At other times, through the image comments, mis-identifications are queried and suggested corrections made. Thirdly, there are several Flickr Groups established where photographers can place images they are unsure of and ask for identification advice.

In this paper, I will give several examples of Flickr Groups that are using innovative techniques for extracting and using images – for example for loading to the Encyclopedia of Life (https://www.flickr.com/groups/encyclopedia_of_life) and the Atlas of Living Australia (https://biocache.ala.org.au/occurrences/8cb21942-0b13-493f-ae1d-ee6fd158f758), as well as by Citizen Science Groups developing comprehensive field guides such as to Insects of Australia using tags to group into orders and familes (https://www.flickr.com/groups/oz_insects), Australian Rainforest Trees using complex tagging to use for species identification (https://www.flickr.com/groups/australianrainforestplants/discuss/72157604373025570), and through developing small specialist groups such as for Australian Native Plants (https://www.flickr.com/groups/australian_native_plants) Pseudoscorpions (https://www.flickr.com/groups/719103@N20), Polypores (https://www.flickr.com/groups/390204@N21), Invasive Species (https://www.flickr.com/groups/18983462@N00), Weeds of Australia (https://www.flickr.com/groups/1553999@N21), etc.

NO,Understanding the Discharge Activities in Transformer Oil under AC and DC Voltage Adopting UHF Technique,"Design of Converter transformer insulation is a major challenge. The insulation of these transformers is stressed by both AC and DC voltages. Particle contamination is one of the major problems in insulation structures, as they generate partial discharges leading it to major failure of insulation. Similarly corona discharges occur in transformer insulation. This partial discharge due to particle movement / corona formation in insulation structure under different voltage wave shapes, are different. In the present study, UHF technique is adopted to understand the discharge activity and could be realized that the characteristics of UHF signal generated under low and high fields are different. In the case of corona generated signal, the frequency content of the UHF sensor output lies in the range 0.3-1.2 GHz and is not much varied except for its increase in magnitude of discharge with the increase in applied voltage. It is realized that the current signal injected due to partial discharges/corona is about 4ns duration measured for first one half cycle. Wavelet technique is adopted in the present study. It allows one to identify the frequency content present in the signal at different instant of time. The STD-MRA analysis helps one to identify the frequency band in which the energy content of the UHF signal is maximum.","- Contamination

NO,Use of Citizen Science Data for Characterizing Patterns and Drivers of Avian Altitudinal Migration,"Altitudinal migration, the seasonal and repeateing movement of animal individuals between breeding and non-breeding areas at different elevations, is a common and important but understudied behavior in birds. Difficulty in characterizing avian altitudinal migration has prevented a comprehensive understanding of both patterns and drivers of this behavior. To fill this knowledge gap, we investigated altitudinal migration patterns and underlying mechanisms for a major proportion (~70%) of an entire resident bird community on a subtropical island with an almost 4000-m elevational gradient. We quantified migration tendency of individual bird species based on the seasonal shift in the elevational distribution of their occurrence records in the eBird database. We then built phylogeny-controlled regression models to examine the associations between the birds' migration tendencies and their functional traits to test major hypotheses on the mechanisms of altitudinal migration. The results showed a common but variable altitudinal migration behavior among the 118 species examined, with 40 and 11 species conducting post-breeding downhill and uphill migration, respectively. The species that have a narrower thermal tolerance range, can tolerate lower temperatures, have a smaller body size, have a more diverse or invertebrate-rich diet, or use an open nest had a higher downhill migration tendency. In contrast, no traits examined showed consistent associations with the uphill migration tendency. This suggests that post-breeding downhill and uphill migrations are driven by different processes and current hypotheses can only explain the former, but not the latter. This relatively comprehensive study demonstrated the power of citizen science data to provide new insights into an old research question from a novel perspective. Using the same approach, we are investigating the behavior in mountain regions around the world. With the global analysis, we will be able to understand the general patterns and mechanisms of avian altitudinal migration and also investigate their variation among mountain regions in different climate zones. In the face of rapid environmental changes in mountain ecosystems, the approach used in this study may also provide essential information for the conservation of mountainous biodiversity.","- eBird

NO,Using a Deep Convolutional Neural Network for Extracting Morphological Traits from Herbarium Images,"Natural history collection data are now accessible through databases and web portals. However, ecological or morphological traits describing specimens are rarely recorded while gathering data.  This lack limits queries and analyses. Manual tagging of millions of specimens will be a huge task even with the help of citizen science projects such as ""les herbonautes"" (http://lesherbonautes.mnhn.fr). On the other hand, deep learning methods that use convolutional neural networks (CNN) demonstrate their efficiency in various domains, such as computer vision (Krizhevsky et al. 2012, Azizpour et al. 2016), speech recognition (Abdel-Hamid et al. 2014) or face identification (Li et al. 2015, Freytag et al. 2016).

We aim to use deep learning to provide a visual representation of words used to describe plants (e.g. simple, or compound leaf), and to associate those words with specimens in the Paris herbarium.  This will provide a semantic description of each of the 7 millions images of the fully digitized collection of the Paris herbarium in the Muséum National d'Histoire Naturelle (MNHN, Paris, France). In a proof of concept project, we have used a CNN - pre-trained on the image database ImageNet (http://www.image-net.org) - in order to identify 4 morphological traits of leaves, using 103,000 herbarium images from 11 different taxa: margin (entire / dentate), leaf attachment (opposite / alternate), leaf organization (simple / compound), plant (woody / non-woody) (see Fig. 1) Seventy percent of images are used to train the weights of the model (in a supervised learning process that uses a training set already tagged for the 4 characteristics), 10% are used as validation set to tune the hyper-parameters of the model and to avoid overfitting, and 20% are used as test set to evaluate the generalization performances of the final neural network. The first results are encouraging with over 80% success on the test set. In a second step, we test if the neural network is not overfitting the training examples, and can generalize to new taxa. If we restrict the training set to a small number of taxa (4 taxa containing 76% of images), the success rate on the 7 other taxa (unseen during training) decreases drastically. A good sampling of the taxonomic diversity of plants appears crucial to train the neural network. A second method visualizes the area of each image that was detected by the CNN as the most important for morphological character recognition (Durand et al. 2017). This method provides an explanatory view of the automatic recognition process. In this poster we describe methods and results on botanical images for the different taxa. We discuss perspectives on image tagging of the Paris herbarium, and how to combine the citizen science project in order to annotate images with CNN automatic image description.","- Deep learning

Abstract: Autistica and the Alan Turing Institute are working together to build a participatory, citizen science platform to gather data on how sensory processing affects autistic people’s navigation of the world. Numerous studies have confirmed that autistic people experience sensory processing differences, and that this can significantly impact their lives. One aspect which is not yet fully understood is how these differences affect the ways in which autistic people navigate different environments. At Discover Conference 2019, I will showcase the team's process of building a project that is participatory from the ground up. We ensure that all aspects of the project are designed and developed in collaboration with members of the autistic community. The platform will be developed under a free and open source license and we commit to making all software, and design and process documents open from the beginning. I will share our progress in building and providing citizen scientists with a fine-grained consent model that supports individual contributor’s personal preferences on how their data is used on the platform. Flipping the traditional scientific study on its head, our goal is to give a voice to the autistic citizen scientists and educate neurotypical people. Audience members will leave knowing how they can join the team and contribute to the project that same day. We seek to empower everyone in supporting autistic people and their families in living long, healthy, happy lives.

NO,Using Crowd-curation to Improve Taxon Annotations on the Wikimedia Infrastructure,"Here we present how two independent infrastructures, Wikimedia and iNaturalist, can be jointly leveraged to improve content on both platforms. iNaturalist.org began as a Master's final project in 2008 and grew to a globally used app to help identify biodiversity. The community behind iNaturalist consists of citizen scientists, who record a species existence through photos or sound recordings. The Wikimedia Foundation provides a spectrum of resources, of which Wikipedia is the most famous sibling. Other siblings we address here are Wikimedia Commons and Wikidata. Commons is the platform where open licensed media can be shared. Wikidata is the linked knowledge graph, where public data can be stored as structured data. Basically, data goes to Wikidata, images and recordings go to Commons and text goes to Wikipedia. Initially, both Commons and Wikidata served primarily the approximately 300 language versions of Wikipedia. However, nowadays both Commons and Wikidata are also being used as is, that is in other contexts than Wikipedia.

Although iNaturalist and the Wikimedia family of repositories thrive as independent infrastructures and are thus maintained independently from each other, they can be mutually beneficial to each other. Content created by the iNaturalist community can be very valuable to the Wikimedia community.

Firstly, observations in the form of  photos and sound recordings can be stored on iNaturalist, with an open and compatible license that can provide valuable illustrations and structured knowledge on biodiversity. Wikipedia articles can be enriched with already approximately 1.2M photos from observations. Furthermore, the assertions made by the iNaturalist community can act as references in various Wikidata claims or Wikipedia articles. In many cases in Wikipedia, we have to rely on personal annotations by the picture taker, who stores it on Wikimedia's multimedia Commons. iNaturalist provides images of organisms with stronger - peer-reviewed - assertions on the subject in the picture. When a cat is called a cat in Wikipedia or Commons, it is the iNaturalist community that either approves or rejects that claim.

In the opposite direction, iNaturalist relies on knowledge described in Wikipedia. It includes Wikipedia articles about taxa on its website. Images can also be uploaded into iNaturalist from Commons. It is therefore possible to add images of museum specimens into iNaturalist to assist with taxon identification.

Other citizen science apps do exist. iNaturalist, however, is particularly interesting due to the feature that it allows its users to select from a selection of licenses, of which some are compatible with the licenses upon which content from the Wikimedia family is available. Wikidata uses a CC0 - public - license for its data, Wikipedia is available under a CC-BY-SA and Commons content uses a selection of Creative Commons licenses (Table 1). iNaturalist is also a particular good fit with Wikimedia, because both have a global and multilingual scope. This is a great example of how platforms can support each other's missions by simple policy decisions, such as open licencing, that underpin interoperability.","- crowd curation

NO,Using Existing Biodiversity Data to Prioritize Survey Areas in Atlas Projects,"Species distribution data is often collected in local and regional atlas projects, in which data is collected in grid squares to ensure optimal data coverage. Nowadays, many different data sources are available, and atlas projects often start with a large number of observations already being available. We show how existing biodiversity data can be used to determine spatial gaps in atlas projects. An citizen science atlas project for vascular plants in the Netherlands shows how existing data are is used to prioritize grid squares with outdated or missing surveys, and grid squares that should be searched for rare and declining species that have been reported in the past. Data from citizen science projects and professional flora surveys are combined in the National Database of Flora and Fauna (www.ndff.nl), which includes the use of data standards and extensive metadata on data collection protocols. This nearly complete database is used in citizen science projects to prioritize the survey of gaps. The concept of a continuously updated atlas scheme is established. Data can be use for several purposes, providing data for the national Red List, as well as reports on protected species,  ecological studies, and the eradication of invasive species.","- citizen science

NO,Utilising the Crowd to Unlock the Data on Herbarium Specimens at the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh,"Digitisation of specimens at the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh (RBGE) has created nearly half a million imaged specimens. With data entry from the specimen labels on herbarium sheets identified as the rate-limiting step in the digitisation workflow, the majority of specimens are databased with minimal data (filing name and geographical region), leaving a need to add further label data (collector, collecting locality, collection date etc.) to make the specimens research ready. We are exploring a number of different ways to complete data entry for specimens that have been imaged. These have included Optical Character Recognition (OCR), to identify meaningful specimen groupings to increase the speed of data entry and more recently citizen science platforms to provide accurate crowd-sourced transcriptions of specimen label data. We sent specimen images of the Australian flowering plants held at RBGE herbarium to DigiVol (https://volunteer.ala.org.au/institution/index/21309224), the citizen science platform developed alongside The Atlas of Living Australia. In 29 expeditions, 156 citizen scientists completed collection label data entry for RBGE's 41,000 specimens of Australian flowering plants.

We found that 95% of the transcriptions were completed by less than a third (27%) of the volunteers. Of the four volunteer experience levels in DigiVol we found that the middle two, Collection Managers and Scientists, transcribed fewer specimens, but also made fewer mistakes. We found that by removing the filing name from the information provided with the expedition the number of errors in the Museum Details section of the transcription decreased, as the filing name was often added as the label name, regardless of whether this is the case. The feedback we provided for each expedition was used to highlight common errors to try and reduce their occurrence as well as to inform the volunteers of what their transcriptions had revealed about this part of the collection. We explore the citizen science transcription workflow, its rate-limiting steps and how we have worked to include the citizen science and OCR data on our online herbarium catalogue.","- crowdsourcing

An analysis of the SNPP / VIIRS / DNB satellite images that have been applied for the determination of public lighting expenditure in the countries of the European Union and to study the variation of light pollution has been carried out as an additional validation of the method. in the municipalities of the Deltebre region. A study of the scientific use of the images taken with digital camera (DSLR) from the International Space Station (ISS) for studies of light pollution has been carried out. It is demonstrated in this work that the type of emitting spectrum of the sources of light pollution can be estimated by color-color diagrams using the three bands of the images and that it is possible to determine the type of lighting technology from the images taken from the ISS. In addition to the classification of sources using synthetic photometry, the absolute photometric calibration of the images was carried out using differential photometry of stellar fields and sources on the ground. As a first step for the scientific exploitation of the nocturnal images of the Earth that are stored in the NASA repository, a citizen science program has been created for the classification, location and geographic referencing of the images. More than 130,000 images have been classified, more than 3000 located, and more than 700 georeferenced. Other methods of capturing nighttime images of sources of light pollution have been explored, such as aerial techniques with hyperspectral and DSLR cameras, from a balloon and using drones. The radiances measured in the images obtained from the satellites have been related to the brightness of the night sky measured from the ground. To gather the necessary information, a method has been developed for the exploration of the spatial variation of the sky brightness that has been applied to the Madrid region, obtaining a map of the sky brightness in the whole region. The temporal variation has been determined with fixed stations of SQM type photometers. Finally, the spectral variation of the sky brightness was determined by continuous monitoring of the sky spectrum in Madrid with the AstMon sky-wide camera and with the SAND spectrograph. This set of measurements constitutes a fundamental data base for the application of models for the diffusion of light pollution through the atmosphere and allows us to conclude that the sky brightness is physically related to the diffuse emission observed in satellite images.","- light pollution

NO,Volunteered Geographic Information for Enhanced Marine Environment Monitoring,"The ability to detect and monitor oil spills at sea is becoming increasingly important due to the high demand of oil-based products. Remote sensing frameworks have been proven to give accurate results in case of major events; nonetheless, also medium and micro oil spills have their own importance, especially in protected areas that deserve special attention. In this paper, we propose a monitoring framework based on the collection of in situ observations and on their integration with remote sensing in order to fill out existing observational gaps. In particular, besides the data collected by special monitoring devices, in situ observations include volunteered geographical information as an additional source of valuable data. Oil spill sights, notified by volunteers through a specially-designed app, are integrated in the monitoring system and therein processed together with remote sensing data in order to proactively detect anomalous events and produce alerts. Field operational tests in two areas demonstrate the technical validity of the approach, while users’ reception testifies to its potential in raising people’s awareness on marine pollution.","- marine environment monitoring

NO,Warum Wissenschaft Bürgerbeteiligung braucht,"Citizen Science oder Bürgerwissenschaft bezeichnet Forschungstätigkeiten, die von Menschen durchgeführt werden, die nicht beruflich als Wissenschaftler arbeiten. Wege, auf solch eine Art und Weise Wissenschaft zu betreiben, gibt es viele – vom ehrenamtlichen Naturschutz über experimentelle Archäologie, partizipative Gesundheitsforschung bis Serious Games in der Biomedizin und darüber hinaus.

Der Vortrag führt in das Thema Citizen Science ein, beleuchtet verschiedene Beispiele und Traditionslinien und gibt einen Überblick über aktuelle Entwicklungen in Deutschland und Europa.

Anhand von Konzepten zu Offener Wissenschaft und Öffentlicher Wissenschaft werden Fragen vorgestellt, die dazu anregen sollen, den gegenwärtigen Erfolg von Citizen Science in breitere Zusammenhänge einzuordnen und zu hinterfragen. Auf dieser Basis soll gemeinsam diskutiert werden, wie Bürgerbeteiligung und Wissenschaft sich gegenseitig bereichern können.

NO,Who needs access to research? Exploring the societal impact of open access,"Studies about open access (OA) have predominantly focused it impact on communication within
the scholarly community. For example, many studies have been published on what is called the
“Open Access Citation Advantage (OACA)”. On the other hand, implications of OA in nonacademic
contexts (e.g. medical practice, policymaking, patient advocacy and citizen science)
have been the subject of and the basis for a lot of the advocacy work and many funding agencies’
OA policies, but not so much the subject of original research studies. To date, this study is the
first attempt to collect and synthesize the available evidence on the societal impact of open
access. It further builds on this evidence base by introducing a typology of the various sciencesociety
interfaces where demand for access to research potentially exists. The proposed scheme
is anticipated to provide guidance for future research on the issue of OA’s societal impact. The
paper concludes with a discussion of the implications of non-academic usage of research on the
open access debate, especially on the question of who should bear the cost of scholarly
publishing.","- open access

NO,WHY WE NEED A NOVEL FRAMEWORK TO INTEGRATE AND TRANSFORM HETEROGENEOUS MULTI-SOURCE GEOREFERENCED INFORMATION: THE J-CO PROPOSAL,"The large number of geo referenced data sets provided by Open Data portals, social media networks and created by volunteers within citizen science projects (Volunteered Geographical Information) is pushing analysts to define and develop novel frameworks for analysing these multisource heterogeneous data sets in order to derive new data sets that generate social value. For analysts, such an activity is becoming a common practice for studying, predicting and planning social dynamics. The convergence of various technologies related with data representation formats, database management and GIS (Geographical Information Systems) can enable analysts to perform such complex integration and transformation processes. JSON has become the de-facto standard for representing (possibly geo-referenced) data sets to share; NoSQL databases (and MongoDB in particular) are able to natively deal with collections of JSON objects; the GIS community has defined the GeoJSON standard, a JSON format for representing georeferenced information layers, and has extended GIS software to support it.","- Collections of JSON objects

I also link to other pieces of information, such as photographs and illustrations as well as outreach efforts by Department of Conservation staff. In addition, I will explain how, by editing Wikidata, Wikimedians can assist in filling gaps that result from a lack of publicly available, comprehensive and authoritative databases. Using practical examples, I will show how data collated and curated in Wikidata can be queried. I will explain how information collated in Wikipedia and Wikimedia Commons is ingested and reused by the citizen science observation platform iNaturalist. I intend to argue that this reuse assists with the creation of more accurate citizen science-generated biodiversity observation data.

NO,"Wikipedia, a Tool for Knowledge Dissemination on Invasive Species","One of the most important issues for controlling the spread of invasive species is public awareness (Dehnen-Schmutz et al. 2018). Passively, the public are responsible for the spread of invasive species, for example by moving dirty boats from one water body to another. But they also actively spread invasive species by releasing them in the wild. The spread of some invasive species could be slowed or even halted if the general public were more aware of the risks. Furthermore, this is a global issue, not restricted to one country or language, and hence needs to be tackled at an international level. The Convention on Biological Diversity has a specific target to identify pathways of introduction and manage invasive species (Convention on Biological Diversity 2014). As part of this awareness-raising, the public needs information on how to identify invasive species, as well as how to know their regulatory status, distribution and transmission. They also need to be aware of how invasive species impact biodiversity, ecosystem services and health. This information needs to be up-to-date, reliable and unbiased, but also supported by evidence.

Many information platforms exist on invasive species and new information is being generated all the time on this dynamic issue. However, pre-eminent among information sources on the internet is Wikipedia. Consistently ranked in the top ten of most visited websites, with more than 15 billion page views a month across 300 language editions, it is the go-to website on many subjects (Wikimedia 2019). Invasive species such as the zebra mussel and water hyacinth receive over 500 daily page views, just on the English edition alone. Wikipedia is arguably one of the largest citizen science projects, containing information on every area of science and connecting, through its citations, scientific literature with the general public.

Wikipedia has been criticized about many aspects of its content and editorship, including its quality and neutrality (Kumar et al. 2016, Wagner et al. 2016, Hargittai and Shaw 2014). Nevertheless, its dominance in the provision of information cannot be ignored and addressing Wikipedia's problems by direct engagement might be more productive than ignoring it. Increasingly, different disciplines are engaging with Wikipedia for communication, recognizing that it can be a productive communication channel (Murray 2018).

Invasive species are a global problem and tackling them is a global issue. We have been investigating the current status of invasive species information on Wikipedia, whether it contains relevant information on impacts and control, and whether the information is consistent across different language versions. We will present what we have found and make recommendations on what to improve and how we can engage with Wikipedia.","- citizen science

NO,Wildlife-vehicle collision hotspots at US highway extents: scale and data source effects,"Highways provide commuter traffic and goods movement among regions and cities through wild, protected areas. Wildlife-vehicle collisions (WVC) can occur frequently when wildlife are present, impacting drivers and animals. Because collisions are often avoidable with constructed mitigation and reduced speeds, transportation agencies often want to know where they can act most effectively and what kinds of mitigation are cost-effective. For this study, WVC occurrences were obtained from two sources: 1) highway agencies that monitor carcass retrieval and disposal by agency maintenance staff and 2) opportunistic observations of carcasses by participants in two statewide systems, the California Roadkill Observation System (CROS; http://wildlifecrossing.net/california) and the Maine Audubon Wildlife Road Watch (MAWRW; http://wildlifecrossing.net/maine). Between September, 2009 and December 31, 2014, >33,700 independent observations of >450 vertebrate species had been recorded in these online, form-based informatics systems by >1,300 observers. We asked whether or not WVC observations collected by these extensive, volunteer-science networks could be used to inform transportation-mitigation planning. Cluster analyses of volunteer-observed WVC were performed using spatial autocorrelation tests for parts or all of 34 state highways and interstates. Statistically-significant WVC hotspots were modeled using the Getis-Ord Gi* statistic. High density locations of WVC, that were not necessarily hotspots, were also visualized. Statistically-significant hotspots were identified along ~7,900 km of highways. These hotspots are shown to vary in position from year to year. For highways with frequent deer-vehicle collisions, annual costs from collisions ranged from US$0 to >US$30,000/km. Carcass clusters from volunteer data had very little or no overlap with similar findings from agency-collected WVC data, during a different time-range. We show that both state agency-collected and volunteer-collection of WVC observations could be useful in prioritizing mitigation action at US state-scales by state transportation agencies to protect biodiversity and driver safety. Because of the spatial extent and taxonomic accuracy at which volunteer observations can be collected, these may be the most important source of data for transportation agencies to protect drivers and wildlife.","- Transportation
