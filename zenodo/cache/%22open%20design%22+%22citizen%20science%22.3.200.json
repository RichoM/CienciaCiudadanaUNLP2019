Here, we review the importance of intact forest ecosystems to dead wood fungi, as well as trends in their diversity research and challenges in conservation. Saproxylic communities are sensitive to transition from virgin forests to managed ecosystems, since the latter often results in reduced tree diversity and the removal of their natural habitat dead wood. The impact of dead wood management can be quite significant since many saproxylic fungi are host-specific. The significance of citizen science and educational programmes for saproxylic mycology is discussed with the emphasis on the North American region.

For example, UGGC allows insights into the (re-) production of urban spaces, promising new options for pro-active urban planning, citizen participation, and local empowerment. However, the unknown quality and high volume of UGGC require advanced filtering and classification procedures to be able to extract new knowledge and actionable intelligence. The complexity of some tasks and the increasing volume of UGGC often restrict the role of citizens to data providers. We argue that citizen should and can play a decisive role in the parameterization and training of deeper computational analysis of UGGC streams. The challenge is how to present geographical analysis problems to a crowd of human supervisors, and how to elicit responses and feed those back into the workflow. We propose a hybrid processing approach, which maps geographical problems into data mining and machine-learning tasks, presents analysis results to human supervisors, and uses the responses to improve the machine-learning and data mining. For the pilot study, we adapt an approach to find semantically distinct places in UGGC. The human supervisors rate the clustering of potentially similar geo-located photographs from the platform Flickr, and thereby help parametrize both the data mining of geospatial clusters, as well as the classification of similar images based on several ancillary attributes.</p>","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.1215682","keywords":["crowdsourcing","citizen science","machine learning","data mining","user-generated geographic content","Flickr","urban places","hybrid processing"],"language":"eng","license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"publication_date":"2018-04-09","related_identifiers":[{"identifier":"10.5281/zenodo.1215681","relation":"isVersionOf","scheme":"doi"}],"relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1215682"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1215681"}}]},"resource_type":{"subtype":"preprint","title":"Preprint","type":"publication"},"title":"Towards a crowdsourced supervision of the analysis of user-generated geographic content: Engaging citizens in discovering urban places"},"owners":[42465],"revision":3,"stats":{"downloads":41.0,"unique_downloads":38.0,"unique_views":133.0,"version_downloads":41.0,"version_unique_downloads":38.0,"version_unique_views":133.0,"version_views":135.0,"version_volume":68846134.0,"views":135.0,"volume":68846134.0},"updated":"2019-04-09T13:39:04.782223+00:00"},{"conceptdoi":"10.5281/zenodo.1466868","conceptrecid":"1466868","created":"2018-10-19T10:56:30.480382+00:00","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.1466869","files":[{"bucket":"4861b3c0-7e32-4217-bb32-cf70083c5b11","checksum":"md5:820c49c973d47c9d3944872a5bc7ae6d","key":"GRECO_Full_Proposal_abc50.pdf","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/4861b3c0-7e32-4217-bb32-cf70083c5b11/GRECO_Full_Proposal_abc50.pdf"},"size":7078466,"type":"pdf"}],"id":1466869,"links":{"badge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.1466869.svg","bucket":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/4861b3c0-7e32-4217-bb32-cf70083c5b11","conceptbadge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.1466868.svg","conceptdoi":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1466868","doi":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1466869","html":"https://zenodo.org/record/1466869","latest":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/1466869","latest_html":"https://zenodo.org/record/1466869","self":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/1466869"},"metadata":{"access_right":"open","access_right_category":"success","communities":[{"id":"greco-787289"}],"contributors":[{"affiliation":"Universidad Politecnica de Madrid","name":"Carlos del Ca\u00f1izo","type":"Researcher"},{"affiliation":"Universidad Pompeu Fabra","name":"Gema Revuelta","type":"Researcher"},{"affiliation":"Universidadde Evora","name":"Luis Fialho","type":"Researcher"},{"affiliation":"Universidad Politecnica de Madrid","name":"Luis Navarte","type":"Researcher"},{"affiliation":"Fenacore","name":"David Hern\u00e1ndez","type":"Researcher"},{"affiliation":"ESCI","name":"Elmar Bartlmae","type":"Researcher"},{"affiliation":"INSOLIGHT","name":"Mathieu Ackermann","type":"Researcher"},{"affiliation":"CLSENES","name":"Nikolay Tyutyundzhiev","type":"Researcher"},{"affiliation":"Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin","name":"Eva Unger","type":"Researcher"},{"affiliation":"Reiner Lemoine Institute","name":"Berit Muller","type":"Researcher"},{"affiliation":"Universidade Sao Paulo","name":"Roberto Zilles","type":"Researcher"}],"creators":[{"affiliation":"Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Madrid","name":"Crist\u00f3bal L\u00f3pez, Ana Bel\u00e9n","orcid":"0000-0002-4314-6160"}],"description":"<p>This is the proposal approved by the European&nbsp;Commission under the call SWAFS-10-2017: Put&nbsp;Open Science into Action.

The fan material likely originates from the surface below the ice sheet, brought up via CO2 jets breaking through the seasonal ice cap. Once the dust and dirt is released into the atmosphere, the material may be blown by the surface winds into the dark streaks visible from orbit. The location, size and direction of these fans record a number of parameters important to quantifying seasonal winds and sublimation activity, the most important agent of geological change extant on Mars. We present results of a systematic mapping of these south polar seasonal fans with the Planet Four online citizen science project. Planet Four enlists the general public to map the shapes, directions, and sizes of the seasonal fans visible in orbital images. Over 80,000 volunteers have contributed to the Planet Four project, reviewing 221 images, from Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter&rsquo;s HiRISE (High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment) camera, taken in southern spring during Mars Years 29 and 30. We provide an overview of Planet Four and detail the processes of combining multiple volunteer assessments together to generate a high delity catalog of &sim; 400000 south polar seasonal fans. We present the results from analyzing the wind directions at several locations monitored by HiRISE over two Mars years, providing new insights into polar surface winds.</p>","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.1475479","journal":{"title":"Icarus","volume":"319"},"license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"publication_date":"2018-10-31","related_identifiers":[{"identifier":"10.5281/zenodo.1475478","relation":"isVersionOf","scheme":"doi"}],"relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1475479"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1475478"}}]},"resource_type":{"subtype":"article","title":"Journal article","type":"publication"},"title":"Planet Four: Probing springtime winds on Mars by mapping the southern polar CO2 jet deposits"},"owners":[2564],"revision":3,"stats":{"downloads":26.0,"unique_downloads":26.0,"unique_views":12.0,"version_downloads":26.0,"version_unique_downloads":26.0,"version_unique_views":12.0,"version_views":12.0,"version_volume":1979467646.0,"views":12.0,"volume":1979467646.0},"updated":"2019-04-09T14:23:36.296174+00:00"},{"conceptdoi":"10.5281/zenodo.1299251","conceptrecid":"1299251","created":"2018-06-27T15:54:35.726493+00:00","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.1299252","files":[{"bucket":"f77918eb-2a7a-4414-9304-8fa9a53ec21b","checksum":"md5:18efed33cb43cb7657731c7b7fcb5d4e","key":"FAIR Data Panel at Advancing Open Science in the EU and the US.odp","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/f77918eb-2a7a-4414-9304-8fa9a53ec21b/FAIR%20Data%20Panel%20at%20Advancing%20Open%20Science%20in%20the%20EU%20and%20the%20US.odp"},"size":2003795,"type":"odp"},{"bucket":"f77918eb-2a7a-4414-9304-8fa9a53ec21b","checksum":"md5:1a7c86cba44d1778de8e177eac01b096","key":"FAIR Data Panel at Advancing Open Science in the EU and the US.pdf","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/f77918eb-2a7a-4414-9304-8fa9a53ec21b/FAIR%20Data%20Panel%20at%20Advancing%20Open%20Science%20in%20the%20EU%20and%20the%20US.pdf"},"size":2148351,"type":"pdf"}],"id":1299252,"links":{"badge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.1299252.svg","bucket":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/f77918eb-2a7a-4414-9304-8fa9a53ec21b","conceptbadge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.1299251.svg","conceptdoi":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1299251","doi":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1299252","html":"https://zenodo.org/record/1299252","latest":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/1299252","latest_html":"https://zenodo.org/record/1299252","self":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/1299252"},"metadata":{"access_right":"open","access_right_category":"success","communities":[{"id":"force2018"},{"id":"osr"}],"creators":[{"affiliation":"Data Science Institute, University of Virginia","name":"Daniel Mietchen","orcid":"0000-0001-9488-1870"}],"description":"<p>This is a contribution (slides at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1299252 ) to the FAIR Data Panel at the &quot;Advancing Open Science in the EU and the US&quot;

It is time-consuming and ultimately subjective. Fortunately, there are solutions to these problems in the form of citizen science projects and machine learning methods. But far more challenging is identification and classification of interacting systems. When armed only with photometry, contaminants such as field stars and unfortuitously projected galaxies often lead to misclassifications (dependence on environment). Similarly, the classifcations rely sensitively on the identification of low-surface brightness features such as tidal arms, streams, and shells (dependence on sky brightness and resolution). Simulations, on the other hand, offer foreknowledge of the stage of an interaction. Using a suite of 24 galaxy interactions covering a range of mass ratios and orbits with corresponding secular evolution runs, we train convolutional neural networks to classify galaxies into three categories: (iso) isolated; (p/i) pair/interacting; and (pm) post-merger. Our networks are trained on images with increasing levels of realism: (0) projected stellar mass maps; (1) full radiative transfer; (2) insertion into real images. We are then well-poised to answer unique questions. How important is the level of realism to the successful classification of interacting systems? How important is it to train the network with contaminating effects (inserting into real images) so that the network may adequately discriminate between bona-fide interactions and false positives? In this talk, I will discuss our answers to these questions.","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.2635339","license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"meeting":{"acronym":"","dates":"February 18-22, 2019","place":"Sydney, Australia","title":"Linking galaxies from the Epoch of initial star-formation to today.

As all crowd-based initiatives are usually built upon a core of volunteers participating to an &ldquo;open call&rdquo; to perform tasks, crowdsensing in particular relies on the willingness of participants to invest time and interest in a cause, sacrifice limited resources of their mobile devices, and provide implicit or explicit efforts, including ignoring risks that impact the privacy of their data. This document describes how incentives and rewarding schemes are adopted in this context to attract a community of users and to keep it engaged. Two incentive schemes in particular are described, both of which have been developed within the CROWD4ROADS project: a game mode that transforms collected data into generated terrain for a 2D&nbsp;platform game and a voucher exchange system that acts as a platform for any initiative for the common good. Both incentive schemes are fully anonymous and integrate within a fully anonymous data collection scheme.</p>","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.2545207","grants":[{"acronym":"CROWD4ROADS","code":"687959","funder":{"acronyms":["EC"],"doi":"10.13039/501100000780","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/funders/10.13039/501100000780"},"name":"European Commission"},"links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/grants/10.13039/501100000780::687959"},"program":"H2020","title":"CROWD sensing and ride sharing FOR ROAD Sustainability"}],"keywords":["CROWD4ROADS","crowdsourcing","crowdsensing","incentives","rewarding","smartroadsense"],"language":"eng","license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"publication_date":"2019-01-21","related_identifiers":[{"identifier":"10.5281/zenodo.2545206","relation":"isVersionOf","scheme":"doi"}],"relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"2545207"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"2545206"}}]},"resource_type":{"subtype":"report","title":"Report","type":"publication"},"title":"Incentives for Crowdsourcing"},"owners":[49537],"revision":3,"stats":{"downloads":46.0,"unique_downloads":41.0,"unique_views":60.0,"version_downloads":46.0,"version_unique_downloads":41.0,"version_unique_views":60.0,"version_views":60.0,"version_volume":9787236.0,"views":60.0,"volume":9787236.0},"updated":"2019-04-10T03:23:28.892763+00:00"},{"conceptdoi":"10.5281/zenodo.2564752","conceptrecid":"2564752","created":"2019-02-14T09:25:26.395669+00:00","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.2564753","files":[{"bucket":"52ccd9fb-2d7c-4d2d-b056-e7a1b25d0ba3","checksum":"md5:95d7064aba29aab78f086b8cadcc0bbc","key":"Final data 2017.zip","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/52ccd9fb-2d7c-4d2d-b056-e7a1b25d0ba3/Final%20data%202017.zip"},"size":12522389,"type":"zip"}],"id":2564753,"links":{"badge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.2564753.svg","bucket":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/52ccd9fb-2d7c-4d2d-b056-e7a1b25d0ba3","conceptbadge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.2564752.svg","conceptdoi":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2564752","doi":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2564753","html":"https://zenodo.org/record/2564753","latest":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/2564753","latest_html":"https://zenodo.org/record/2564753","self":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/2564753"},"metadata":{"access_right":"open","access_right_category":"success","contributors":[{"affiliation":"IDAEA-CSIC","name":"Viana, Mar","orcid":"0000-0002-4073-3802","type":"ContactPerson"}],"creators":[{"affiliation":"IDAEA-CSIC","name":"Viana, Mar","orcid":"0000-0002-4073-3802"},{"affiliation":"IDAEA-CSIC","name":"Ripoll, Anna"},{"affiliation":"UPC","name":"Barcel\u00f3-Ordinas, Jose Mar\u00eda","orcid":"0000-0002-9738-2425"},{"affiliation":"UPC","name":"Garc\u00eda Vidal, Jorge","orcid":"0000-0001-5969-1182"}],"description":"<p>Ozone concentrations in ambient air collected using low-cost sensor technologies, in the framework of EU project CAPTOR.

In many countries more than one language is in common usage. Belgium, for example, has three official languages. Crowdsourcing has helped many collections digitize their labels and generates useful data for science. Furthermore, direct engagement of the public with a herbarium increases the collection's visibility and potentially reinforces a sense of common ownership. For these reasons we built DoeDat, a multilingual crowdsourcing platform forked from Digivol of the Australian Museum (Figs 1, 2). Some of the useful features we inherited from Digivol include a georeferencing tool, configurable templates, simple project management and individual institutional branding.</p>\n  <p>Running a multilingual website does increase the work needed to setup and manage projects, but we hope to gain from the broader engagement we can attract. Currently, we are focusing our work on Belgian collections were Dutch and French are the primary languages, but in the future we may expand our languages when we work on our international collections. We also hope that we can eventually merge our code with that of Digivol, so that we can both benefit from each other's developments.</p>","doi":"10.3897/biss.2.25148","imprint":{"publisher":"Pensoft Publishers"},"journal":{"issue":"","pages":"e25148","title":"Biodiversity Information Science and Standards","volume":"2"},"keywords":["public engagement","internationalization","citizen science","herbarium","transcription","data capture"],"license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"publication_date":"2018-05-17","relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1252560"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1252559"}}]},"resource_type":{"subtype":"article","title":"Journal article","type":"publication"},"title":"A fork in the alphabet soup: DoeDat a multilingual crowdsourcing platform"},"owners":[1161],"revision":3,"stats":{"downloads":17.0,"unique_downloads":17.0,"unique_views":8.0,"version_downloads":17.0,"version_unique_downloads":17.0,"version_unique_views":8.0,"version_views":8.0,"version_volume":2969781.0,"views":8.0,"volume":2969781.0},"updated":"2019-04-09T13:46:47.602931+00:00"},{"conceptdoi":"10.5281/zenodo.1204079","conceptrecid":"1204079","created":"2018-03-20T10:01:15.761360+00:00","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.1204080","files":[{"bucket":"5a983677-4a94-403a-a9a2-4c0a40ee284f","checksum":"md5:7340355f1a50dbd9f0da3a25e803e728","key":"lake_level_Braccianosmartlake_VGI.xls","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/5a983677-4a94-403a-a9a2-4c0a40ee284f/lake_level_Braccianosmartlake_VGI.xls"},"size":38912,"type":"xls"}],"id":1204080,"links":{"badge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.1204080.svg","bucket":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/5a983677-4a94-403a-a9a2-4c0a40ee284f","conceptbadge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.1204079.svg","conceptdoi":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1204079","doi":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1204080","html":"https://zenodo.org/record/1204080","latest":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/1204080","latest_html":"https://zenodo.org/record/1204080","self":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/1204080"},"metadata":{"access_right":"open","access_right_category":"success","creators":[{"affiliation":"Lifeguard  Bracciano","name":"Behfar, Armin"},{"affiliation":"feguard, Bracciano Crocicchi, Marco, Parco Regionale Naturale Lago di Bracciano, Italy","name":"Crocicchi, Marco"},{"affiliation":"Citizen Scientist","name":"Loreto, Tommaso"},{"affiliation":"Geologist ,Bracciano Smart Lake","name":"Mecali, Alessandro"},{"affiliation":"Centro Surf Bracciano,Bracciano RM Italy","name":"Notino, Simone"},{"affiliation":"journalist Bracciano Smart Lake","name":"Perugini,Emanuele"},{"affiliation":"IRSA CNR","name":"Rossi, David"},{"affiliation":"Citizen Scientist","name":"Sulla, Antonio"}],"description":"<p>This VGI dataset contains the daily level data ( in meters&nbsp; on sea level during the period 06-03-2015 to 19-03-2018)&nbsp; directly observed on the idrometers available at three locations ( Molo degli Inglesi , Molo of Anguillara, Molo of Trevignano)&nbsp; in&nbsp; Bracciano&#39;s lake, Latium ,Italy and freely availables at website https://braccianosmartlake.com/rilevamento-quota-lago/.</p>\n\n<p>In the datafile, given in excel format, a cubic spline interpolation are computed on the raw data in order to give a daily continuos profile of lake&#39;s level.</p>\n\n<p>A referenced daily mean level obtained from ACEA data are also provided for 1995-2017 in the dataset file.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.1204080","keywords":["lake , bracciano , level of water, citizen scienze"],"language":"eng","license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"notes":"Bracciano Smartlake is a citizen science initiative supported by a scientific council.

The products and platform will provide the robust data to support decision making on biodiversity conservation, fundamental research on biodiversity evolution and spatial patterns,\u00a0and\u00a0species identification for citizen science. China flora online will include 35,000 species of higher plants in China and an online editing environment for botanists to maintain the floral records. The trait database will include structured data of animals, plants and fungi, such as weight, height, length, color and shape of organisms. This species catalogue will be the\u00a0annually\u00a0updated version of the Catalogue of Life, China. The distribution maps will show the spatial pattern for each species of vertebrate animal and higher plant.

accumulation of alien species (AS) introductions worldwide, additionally the rate of spread for some species has also been shown to be increasing. However, the challenges of gathering information on AS are recognized. Recent developments in citizen science (CS) provide an opportunity to improve data flow and knowledge on AS while ensuring effective and high quality societal engagement with the issue of IAS (Invasive Alien Species). Advances in technology, particularly on-line recording and smartphone apps, along with the development of social media, have revolutionized CS and increased connectivity while new and innovative analysis techniques are emerging to ensure appropriate management, visualization, interpretation and use and sharing of the data. In early July 2018 we launched a European CO-operation in Science and Technology (COST) Action to address multidisciplinary research questions in relation to developing and implementing CS, advancing scientific understanding of AS dynamics while informing decision-making specifically implementation of technical requirements of relevant legislation such as the EU Regulation 1143/2014 on IAS. It will also support the EU biodiversity goals and embedding science within society. The Action will explore and document approaches to establishing a European-wide CS AS network. It will embrace relevant innovations for data gathering and reporting to support the implementation of monitoring and surveillance measures, while ensuring benefits for society and citizens, through an AS CS European network. The Action will, therefore, increase levels of participation and quality of engagement with current CS initiatives, ensuring and evaluating educational value, and improve the value outcomes for potential users including citizens, scientists, alien species managers, policy-makers, local authorities, industry and other stakeholders.</p>","doi":"10.3897/rio.4.e31412","imprint":{"publisher":"Pensoft Publishers"},"journal":{"issue":"","pages":"e31412","title":"Research Ideas and Outcomes","volume":"4"},"keywords":["public participation in science","invasive species","monitoring","public awareness","visualisation","communication","conservation"],"license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"publication_date":"2018-11-07","relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1488451"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1488450"}}]},"resource_type":{"subtype":"article","title":"Journal article","type":"publication"},"title":"Increasing understanding of alien species through citizen science (Alien-CSI)"},"owners":[1161],"revision":3,"stats":{"downloads":18.0,"unique_downloads":18.0,"unique_views":8.0,"version_downloads":18.0,"version_unique_downloads":18.0,"version_unique_views":8.0,"version_views":8.0,"version_volume":13773060.0,"views":8.0,"volume":13773060.0},"updated":"2019-04-09T14:25:27.406599+00:00"},{"conceptrecid":"995404","created":"2017-09-24T06:58:51.595537+00:00","doi":"10.3897/phytokeys.85.14925.figure4","files":[{"bucket":"09ad2385-9eed-4595-bdff-4f8615738b8e","checksum":"md5:0469d7f07dc5ff8fe1bdc79a2106bba4","key":"big_149259.jpg","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/09ad2385-9eed-4595-bdff-4f8615738b8e/big_149259.jpg"},"size":284438,"type":"jpg"}],"id":995405,"links":{"badge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.3897/phytokeys.85.14925.figure4.svg","bucket":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/09ad2385-9eed-4595-bdff-4f8615738b8e","doi":"https://doi.org/10.3897/phytokeys.85.14925.figure4","html":"https://zenodo.org/record/995405","latest":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/995405","latest_html":"https://zenodo.org/record/995405","self":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/995405","thumb250":"https://zenodo.org/api/iiif/v2/09ad2385-9eed-4595-bdff-4f8615738b8e:badecab4-eebc-47e3-9b06-c410d535eeaf:big_149259.jpg/full/250,/0/default.jpg"},"metadata":{"access_right":"open","access_right_category":"success","communities":[{"id":"biosyslit"}],"creators":[{"affiliation":"Natuurpunt Studie, Coxiestraat 11, 2800 Mechelen, Belgium","name":"Steeman, Roosmarijn"},{"affiliation":"Natuurpunt Studie, Coxiestraat 11, 2800 Mechelen, Belgium","name":"Vanreusel, Wouter"},{"affiliation":"Plantenwerkgroep Genk, 3600 Genk, Belgium","name":"Barendse, Rutger"},{"affiliation":"Botanic Garden of Meise, Nieuwelaan 38, 1860 Meise, Belgium","name":"Verloove, Filip"},{"affiliation":"Natuurpunt, Coxiestraat 11, 2800 Mechelen, Belgium","name":"Wysmantel, Nico"},{"affiliation":"Natuurpunt, Coxiestraat 11, 2800 Mechelen, Belgium","name":"Van den Bussche, Walter"},{"affiliation":"Natuurpunt, Coxiestraat 11, 2800 Mechelen, Belgium","name":"Gyselinck, Thomas"},{"affiliation":"Natuurpunt Beheer, Coxiestraat 11, 2800 Mechelen, Belgium","name":"Hendrickx, Pieter"},{"affiliation":"WVI, Baron Ruzettelaan 35, 8310 Brugge, Belgium","name":"Zwaenepoel, Arnout"},{"affiliation":"Natuurpunt, Coxiestraat 11, 2800 Mechelen, Belgium","name":"Van Vooren, Pierre"},{"affiliation":"University of Antwerp, Wilrijk, Belgium","name":"Jacobs, Steven"},{"affiliation":"Research Institute for Nature and Forest (INBO), Kliniekstraat 25, 1070 Brussels, Belgium","name":"Desmet, Peter"},{"affiliation":"Natuurpunt Studie, Coxiestraat 11, 2800 Mechelen, Belgium","name":"Gielen, Karin"},{"affiliation":"Natuurpunt Studie, Coxiestraat 11, 2800 Mechelen, Belgium","name":"Herremans, Marc"},{"affiliation":"Evolutionary Ecology Group, University of Antwerp, Universiteitsplein 1, 2610 Wilrijk, Belgium","name":"Swinnen, Kristijn R.R."}],"description":"Figure 4 - \n          Left: the number of plant observations per IFBL grid cell.

Since 2015, they organized &ldquo;Cammini LTER&rdquo;, trails connecting a number of LTER-Italy sites, where researchers walked and cycled with citizens, sharing research questions, methodologies and results. The citizens&rsquo; engagement through a physical and visible movement of researchers outside their laboratories enhanced the opportunity to familiarize with a wide variety of Italian ecosystems and with the LTER data acquisition procedures. The slow rhythm of walking or cycling offers the possibility to overcome an exclusively rational and cognitive approach, breaking down the barriers between science and society, and bringing emotions and affectivity into the ecological subjects.

Finally, the last section 10 ideas to include the RRI perspective in STEM Education offers a useful guide of ten big ideas about how RRI perspective could be brought to STEM Education, considering the pillars and processes that characterize the RRI paradigm and linking these big ideas with the several methodologies in STEM education.</p>","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.1303805","grants":[{"acronym":"STEM4youth","code":"710577","funder":{"acronyms":["EC"],"doi":"10.13039/501100000780","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/funders/10.13039/501100000780"},"name":"European Commission"},"links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/grants/10.13039/501100000780::710577"},"program":"H2020","title":"Promotion of STEM education by key scientific challenges and their impact on our life and career perspectives"}],"keywords":["RRI, stem education, citizen science, R&I, learning"],"language":"eng","license":{"id":"CC-BY-SA-4.0"},"publication_date":"2018-07-03","related_identifiers":[{"identifier":"10.5281/zenodo.1303804","relation":"isVersionOf","scheme":"doi"}],"relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1303805"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1303804"}}]},"resource_type":{"subtype":"report","title":"Report","type":"publication"},"title":"10 ideas to include the RRI perspective in STEM education"},"owners":[40107],"revision":2,"stats":{"downloads":67.0,"unique_downloads":63.0,"unique_views":74.0,"version_downloads":67.0,"version_unique_downloads":63.0,"version_unique_views":74.0,"version_views":78.0,"version_volume":144538028.0,"views":78.0,"volume":144538028.0},"updated":"2018-07-03T08:53:46.909143+00:00"},{"conceptdoi":"10.5281/zenodo.1438459","conceptrecid":"1438459","created":"2018-09-28T17:24:50.803986+00:00","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.1438460","files":[{"bucket":"b11b44eb-9096-482e-951d-d9675738d020","checksum":"md5:af2361a64d98f36b72662e677698ebf3","key":"GROOM_S1.5_GFBio Paper 53.pdf","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/b11b44eb-9096-482e-951d-d9675738d020/GROOM_S1.5_GFBio%20Paper%2053.pdf"},"size":2410545,"type":"pdf"}],"id":1438460,"links":{"badge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.1438460.svg","bucket":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/b11b44eb-9096-482e-951d-d9675738d020","conceptbadge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.1438459.svg","conceptdoi":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1438459","doi":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1438460","html":"https://zenodo.org/record/1438460","latest":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/1438460","latest_html":"https://zenodo.org/record/1438460","self":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/1438460"},"metadata":{"access_right":"open","access_right_category":"success","creators":[{"affiliation":"Meise Botanic Garden","name":"Groom, Quentin","orcid":"0000-0002-0596-5376"},{"affiliation":"Belgian Biodiversity Platform","name":"Vanderhoeven, Sonia","orcid":"0000-0002-6298-5373"},{"affiliation":"INBO (Research Institure for Nature and Forest)","name":"Reyserhove, Lien","orcid":"0000-0001-7484-9267"},{"affiliation":"INBO (Research Institure for Nature and Forest)","name":"Oldoni, Damiano","orcid":"0000-0003-3445-7562"},{"affiliation":"INBO (Research Institure for Nature and Forest)","name":"Adriaens, Tim","orcid":"0000-0001-7268-4200"},{"affiliation":"INBO (Research Institure for Nature and Forest)","name":"Desmet, Peter","orcid":"0000-0002-8442-8025"}],"description":"<p>A presentation on the TrIAS project&nbsp;to the International Conference on Ecological Informatics 2018, held in Jena, Germany. 24-28 September 2018.</p>\n\n<p>Details on the TrIAS project can be found here...</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Groom, Q.

In the field of biology, new species and new interspecies associations are constantly discovered by making use of museum collections, digitalised materials or citizen science programs. In our study, the Myrmica Latreille, 1804 image collection of AntWeb.org was screened for fungal ectoparasites. A total of 397 imaged specimens from 133 species were visually investigated. A single specimen of M. hellenica Finzi, 1926, collected in Greece by U. Sahlberg, showed a conspicuous fungal infection. The parasite was identified using microscopic methods as Rickia wasmannii Cavara, an ectoparasitic fungal species specialised to Myrmica ants. This finding represents a new country record and a new Myrmica species for the host spectrum of R. wasmannii. According to our results, online entomological databases can be screened relatively easily for ectoparasitic fungal infections from new hosts and new regions. However, depending on quality of the insect voucher photos, additional investigation of the material could be needed to confirm the identity of the parasite.</p>","doi":"10.3897/jhr.61.20255","imprint":{"publisher":"Pensoft Publishers"},"journal":{"issue":"","pages":"85-94","title":"Journal of Hymenoptera Research","volume":"61"},"keywords":["Fungi","Ascomycota","Laboulbeniomycetes","Laboulbeniales","Laboulbeniaceae","Rickia","Rickia wasmannii","Biological collections","database","Myrmica hellenica","distribution","Greece"],"license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"publication_date":"2017-12-20","relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1138954"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1138953"}}]},"resource_type":{"subtype":"article","title":"Journal article","type":"publication"},"title":"Online image databases as multi-purpose resources: discovery of a new host ant of Rickia wasmannii Cavara (Ascomycota, Laboulbeniales) by screening AntWeb.org"},"owners":[1161],"revision":4,"stats":{"downloads":17.0,"unique_downloads":15.0,"unique_views":4.0,"version_downloads":17.0,"version_unique_downloads":15.0,"version_unique_views":4.0,"version_views":4.0,"version_volume":23104902.0,"views":4.0,"volume":23104902.0},"updated":"2019-04-09T13:26:19.420970+00:00"},{"conceptrecid":"2641434","created":"2019-04-16T04:30:07.072744+00:00","doi":"10.3897/zookeys.836.29252","files":[{"bucket":"37fa270f-0037-4fb8-ad0e-224c08f26164","checksum":"md5:659cfc925e03c19305bc9d877f18b1e2","key":"29252_PDF_1_189421_LE_292273.pdf","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/37fa270f-0037-4fb8-ad0e-224c08f26164/29252_PDF_1_189421_LE_292273.pdf"},"size":1333358,"type":"pdf"},{"bucket":"37fa270f-0037-4fb8-ad0e-224c08f26164","checksum":"md5:2d6dd989abd113ff107650b9db169ba5","key":"ZK_article_29252.xml","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/37fa270f-0037-4fb8-ad0e-224c08f26164/ZK_article_29252.xml"},"size":169433,"type":"xml"}],"id":2641435,"links":{"badge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.3897/zookeys.836.29252.svg","bucket":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/37fa270f-0037-4fb8-ad0e-224c08f26164","doi":"https://doi.org/10.3897/zookeys.836.29252","html":"https://zenodo.org/record/2641435","latest":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/2641435","latest_html":"https://zenodo.org/record/2641435","self":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/2641435"},"metadata":{"access_right":"open","access_right_category":"success","communities":[{"id":"biosyslit"}],"creators":[{"affiliation":"BRC Foundation, Bennekom, Netherlands","name":"Wehrmann, Jasper"},{"affiliation":"BRC Foundation, Bennekom, Netherlands|Zostera B.V., Boskoop, Netherlands","name":"de Boer, Folkert"},{"affiliation":"BRC Foundation, Bennekom, Netherlands","name":"Benjumea, Rafa"},{"affiliation":"BRC Foundation, Bennekom, Netherlands","name":"Cavaill\u00e8s, Simon"},{"affiliation":"BRC Foundation, Bennekom, Netherlands","name":"Engelen, Dries"},{"affiliation":"BRC Foundation, Bennekom, Netherlands","name":"Jansen, Johannes"},{"affiliation":"BirdLife Europe and Central Asia, Brussels, Belgium","name":"Verhelst, Brecht"},{"affiliation":"BRC Foundation, Bennekom, Netherlands|University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands","name":"Vansteelant, Wouter M.G."}],"description":"<p>One of the most important geographical bottlenecks for migrating raptors in the east African-Palearctic migration system is situated between the easternmost tip of the Black Sea and the Lesser Caucasus, just north of Batumi, in the Republic of Georgia.

To date much of this work has focused on plants, but animal specimens are also useful in this regard. In particular, bird specimens may include data on age, gonad size and development, and molt, all of which are relevant to estimating breeding phenology. In addition, bird collections include nests and eggs, which are direct records of breeding. These data are some of the richest available for any vertebrate group, and the potential for integration with citizen-science-based data (e.g. eBird) is extremely promising. However, there are a number of challenges associated with use of these data, including biased geographic sampling, incomplete digitization, and non-uniform data standards, that currently limit their utility. In addition, methods for analysis of these data have not been well developed. Here, we outline informatics challenges associated with developing a database of avian gonad size data. In addition, we present a novel analytical framework for estimating phenology from such data (Fig. 1) that is broadly applicable to seasonal phenotype measurements.</p>","doi":"10.3897/tdwgproceedings.1.20324","imprint":{"publisher":"Pensoft Publishers"},"journal":{"issue":"","pages":"e20324","title":"Biodiversity Information Science and Standards","volume":"1"},"keywords":["phenology","birds","gonad","periodic regression"],"license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"publication_date":"2017-08-15","relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1140571"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1140570"}}]},"resource_type":{"subtype":"article","title":"Journal article","type":"publication"},"title":"The use of avian museum specimen data in phenology studies: prospects and challenges"},"owners":[1161],"revision":4,"stats":{"downloads":18.0,"unique_downloads":16.0,"unique_views":6.0,"version_downloads":18.0,"version_unique_downloads":16.0,"version_unique_views":6.0,"version_views":6.0,"version_volume":1564502.0,"views":6.0,"volume":1564502.0},"updated":"2019-04-09T13:26:53.551791+00:00"},{"conceptdoi":"10.5281/zenodo.2254311","conceptrecid":"2254311","created":"2018-12-13T20:28:44.905883+00:00","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.2254312","files":[{"bucket":"977731ab-8f73-4b45-8946-e9cd81e3bc16","checksum":"md5:4858547aee6b4d656167e9b33f4d1baa","key":"Laine Heidi_Open Science in RI CoCs.pdf","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/977731ab-8f73-4b45-8946-e9cd81e3bc16/Laine%20Heidi_Open%20Science%20in%20RI%20CoCs.pdf"},"size":468248,"type":"pdf"}],"id":2254312,"links":{"badge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.2254312.svg","bucket":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/977731ab-8f73-4b45-8946-e9cd81e3bc16","conceptbadge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.2254311.svg","conceptdoi":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2254311","doi":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2254312","html":"https://zenodo.org/record/2254312","latest":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/2254312","latest_html":"https://zenodo.org/record/2254312","self":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/2254312"},"metadata":{"access_right":"open","access_right_category":"success","creators":[{"affiliation":"University of Helsinki","name":"Laine, Heidi","orcid":"0000-0002-6658-0664"}],"description":"<p>Abstract</p>\n\n<p>The purpose of this article is to examine the conceptual alignment between the ethical principles of research integrity and open science. Research integrity is represented in this study by four general codes of conduct on responsible conduct of research (RCR), three of them international in scope, and one national. A representative list of ethical principles associated with open science is compiled in order to create categories for assessing the content of the codes. According to the analysis, the current understanding of RCR is too focused on traditional publications and the so called FFP definition of research misconduct to fully support open science. The main gaps include recognising citizen science and societal outreach and supporting open collaboration both among the research community and beyond its traditional borders. Updates for both the content of CoCs as well as the processes of creating such guidelines are suggested.</p>","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.2254312","journal":{"issue":"4/2018","title":"Informaatiotutkimus"},"keywords":["open science","open scholarship","research ethics","research integrity","science studies","code of conduct","research community","self-regulation"],"language":"eng","license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"notes":"Research funded by Tiina and Antti Herlin Foundation","publication_date":"2018-12-13","related_identifiers":[{"identifier":"10.5281/zenodo.2254311","relation":"isVersionOf","scheme":"doi"}],"relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"2254312"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"2254311"}}]},"resource_type":{"subtype":"preprint","title":"Preprint","type":"publication"},"title":"Open Science and Codes of Conduct on Research Integrity"},"owners":[20514],"revision":14,"stats":{"downloads":21.0,"unique_downloads":20.0,"unique_views":13.0,"version_downloads":21.0,"version_unique_downloads":20.0,"version_unique_views":13.0,"version_views":14.0,"version_volume":9833208.0,"views":14.0,"volume":9833208.0},"updated":"2019-04-10T02:06:50.131511+00:00"},{"conceptrecid":"1445718","created":"2018-10-04T16:17:57.649628+00:00","doi":"10.3390/app8101743","files":[{"bucket":"03214915-b11a-43b2-97bc-270957535c84","checksum":"md5:6044ecb184f24e485618b9dbe44954a0","key":"applsci-08-01743.pdf","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/03214915-b11a-43b2-97bc-270957535c84/applsci-08-01743.pdf"},"size":2484713,"type":"pdf"}],"id":1445719,"links":{"badge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.3390/app8101743.svg","bucket":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/03214915-b11a-43b2-97bc-270957535c84","doi":"https://doi.org/10.3390/app8101743","html":"https://zenodo.org/record/1445719","latest":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/1445719","latest_html":"https://zenodo.org/record/1445719","self":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/1445719"},"metadata":{"access_right":"open","access_right_category":"success","communities":[{"id":"fp7-bmc"}],"creators":[{"affiliation":"CNR-ISTI","name":"Martinelli, Massimo","orcid":"0000-0001-7419-5099"},{"affiliation":"CNR-ISTI","name":"Moroni, Davide","orcid":"0000-0002-5175-5126"}],"description":"<p>The ability to detect and monitor oil spills at sea is becoming increasingly important due to the high demand of oil-based products. Remote sensing frameworks have been proven to give accurate results in case of major events; nonetheless, also medium and micro oil spills have their own importance, especially in protected areas that deserve special attention. In this paper, we propose a monitoring framework based on the collection of in situ observations and on their integration with remote sensing in order to fill out existing observational gaps. In particular, besides the data collected by special monitoring devices, in situ observations include volunteered geographical information as an additional source of valuable data. Oil spill sights, notified by volunteers through a specially-designed app, are integrated in the monitoring system and therein processed together with remote sensing data in order to proactively detect anomalous events and produce alerts.

It will do this by implementing a generative research cycle involving networking, dialogue, participatory research and interpretation phases centered around and driven by children and young people, out of which a diverse range of outputs, critical perspectives and other insights will emerge to inform policy and decision-making in relation to children and young people&rsquo;s needs in relation to digital society. The WYRED Platform is already developed, but the target group, young people, should accept it to ensure project aims.

However, potential applications of machine learning methods in biodiversity research are often limited by the relative scarcity of data suitable for training machine learning models. Development of high-quality training data sets can be a surprisingly challenging task that can easily consume hundreds of person-hours of time. In this talk, we present the results of our recent work implementing and comparing several different methods for generating annotated, biodiversity-oriented image data for training machine learning models, including collaborative expert scoring, local volunteer image annotators with on-site training, and distributed, remote image annotation via citizen science platforms. We discuss error rates, among-annotator variance, and depth of coverage required to ensure highly reliable image annotations.  We also discuss time considerations and efficiency of the various methods. Finally, we present new software, called ImageAnt (currently under development), that supports efficient, highly flexible image annotation workflows. ImageAnt was created primarily in response to the challenges we discovered in our own efforts to generate image-based training data for machine learning models. ImageAnt features a simple user interface and can be used to implement sophisticated, adaptive scripting of image annotation tasks.</p>","doi":"10.3897/biss.3.37615","imprint":{"publisher":"Pensoft Publishers"},"journal":{"issue":"","pages":"e37615","title":"Biodiversity Information Science and Standards","volume":"3"},"keywords":["machine learning","computer vision","image labeling"],"license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"publication_date":"2019-07-02","relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"3289056"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"3289055"}}]},"resource_type":{"subtype":"article","title":"Journal article","type":"publication"},"title":"Methods, New Software Tools, and Best Practices for Developing High-quality Training Data for Machine Learning-based Image Analysis in Biodiversity Research"},"owners":[1161],"revision":2,"stats":{"downloads":3.0,"unique_downloads":3.0,"unique_views":3.0,"version_downloads":3.0,"version_unique_downloads":3.0,"version_unique_views":3.0,"version_views":3.0,"version_volume":176877.0,"views":3.0,"volume":176877.0},"updated":"2019-07-10T07:05:57.610036+00:00"},{"conceptdoi":"10.5281/zenodo.1482872","conceptrecid":"1482872","created":"2018-11-11T14:36:37.395311+00:00","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.1482873","files":[{"bucket":"6093326a-e49c-46f4-b9f5-f0dd49c9c189","checksum":"md5:a4e12d62f6b4d567f6f2672bf46b5fca","key":"MicroDraw_OHBM2015.pdf","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/6093326a-e49c-46f4-b9f5-f0dd49c9c189/MicroDraw_OHBM2015.pdf"},"size":3475578,"type":"pdf"}],"id":1482873,"links":{"badge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.1482873.svg","bucket":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/6093326a-e49c-46f4-b9f5-f0dd49c9c189","conceptbadge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.1482872.svg","conceptdoi":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1482872","doi":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1482873","html":"https://zenodo.org/record/1482873","latest":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/1482873","latest_html":"https://zenodo.org/record/1482873","self":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/1482873"},"metadata":{"access_right":"open","access_right_category":"success","creators":[{"affiliation":"Institut Pasteur","name":"Toro, Roberto","orcid":"0000-0002-6671-858X"},{"affiliation":"Max Planck Institute  for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences","name":"Katja Heuer","orcid":"0000-0002-7237-0196"}],"description":"<p>An A0 poster which is designed for fabric print and can be&nbsp;cut and sewed into a bag.</p>\n\n<p>The poster was presented at the 2015 Annual Meeting of the Organization for Human Brain Mapping (OHBM) in Hawaii, 14&ndash;18 June.</p>\n\n<p>MicroDraw is a web application by&nbsp;<a href=\"http://neuroanatomy.github.io/\">NAAT</a>&nbsp;to visualise and collaboratively annotate high resolution histology data.

These include species information\u00a0Fig. 1 (e.g. descriptions, photos\u00a0and administrative attributes); citizen science platforms enabling recording, managing and sharing of observation data; an e-learning environment for species identification; management and sharing of restricted data among authorities; building a national DNA barcode reference library and linking it to species occurrence data; community-driven species identification support; large-scale and multi-technology digitisation of natural history collections; and IUCN Red Listing\u00a0to conduct a periodic national assesment of the status of the threatened species.</p>\n  <p>To improve the taxonomic coverage and the content of species information, FinBIF is starting a process to collaborate with the species information community at large, in order to collate already existing but not yet openly distributed information.

Scientific and technical challenges need to be met for building global EBV data products even for the most &ldquo;classic&rdquo; EBVs with which biodiversity experts (in particular, conservation biologists) are traditionally familiarized, such as &lsquo;species distribution&rsquo; or &lsquo;population abundance&rsquo;. These challenges imply, e.g. the need (i) to develop tools and models for combining heterogeneous, multi-source datasets and filling data gaps in geographic, temporal and taxonomic coverage; (ii) to integrate new methods and technologies for data collection such as sensor networks, DNA-based techniques, and satellite remote sensing; (iii) to solve major technical issues related to data product structure, data storage, execution of workflows, and the production process/cycle as well as approaching technical interoperability among research infrastructures, or (v) to achieve semantic interoperability by adopting standards and tools for capturing consistent metadata. Since all EBVs are produced from heterogeneous types of data, such as those provided by natural history collections, national and international monitoring programs, research surveys, or citizen science initiatives, from the law &amp; policy perspective the challenges include mainly three sets of problems:</p>\n\n<p>(1) providing frameworks for making scientific and technically sound authoritative decisions for the building of EBV products;</p>\n\n<p>(2) ensuring legal interoperability by endorsing open data or data that are free from restrictions on access, use, modification, and sharing; and</p>\n\n<p>(3) providing a framework for making authoritative decisions on minimum requirements of data policies attached to the data used in EBV products and the products themselves along the workflows embedded in the continuum of the EBV production processes since a) individual researchers and teams act as if data were proprietary, and the use of data is not necessarily designated as open; b) there is a high possibility that EBV products may have to be built using data from providers with incompatible data policies (e.g. using of different datasets for the same species from providers with different data policies) even if intended to be open and non proprietary; and c) the mere existence of data, datasets and other derivative products is built on practices of Big Data management techniques (e.g. citizen science) that may create other conditions or legal limitations to their use and re-use.</p>\n\n<p>This paper addresses these three different law &amp; policy issues in order to elaborate a set of recommendations for all actors, from individual scientists to institutions involved in the provision of raw data to the EBVs products all along the continuum between primary data observations (&lsquo;raw data&rsquo;) and synthetic or derived indices (&lsquo;indicators&rsquo;) to final products development for EBVs calculations.</p>","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.1323495","grants":[{"acronym":"GLOBIS-B","code":"654003","funder":{"acronyms":["EC"],"doi":"10.13039/501100000780","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/funders/10.13039/501100000780"},"name":"European Commission"},"links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/grants/10.13039/501100000780::654003"},"program":"H2020","title":"GLOBal Infrastructures for Supporting Biodiversity research"}],"keywords":["Biodiversity informatics","Research infrastructures","Essential Biodiversity Variables","Biodiversity and Ecosystems data","Workflow development","Legal interoperability","Aichi targets"],"language":"eng","license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"publication_date":"2018-01-05","related_identifiers":[{"identifier":"10.5281/zenodo.1323494","relation":"isVersionOf","scheme":"doi"}],"relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1323495"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1323494"}}]},"resource_type":{"subtype":"report","title":"Report","type":"publication"},"title":"GLOBIS-B Position Paper for Policymakers on the Potential Solutions to Scientific, Technical and Legal Interoperability Issues"},"owners":[6733],"revision":3,"stats":{"downloads":12.0,"unique_downloads":10.0,"unique_views":8.0,"version_downloads":12.0,"version_unique_downloads":10.0,"version_unique_views":8.0,"version_views":8.0,"version_volume":19546224.0,"views":8.0,"volume":19546224.0},"updated":"2018-08-04T20:25:42.510780+00:00"},{"conceptrecid":"818629","created":"2017-06-26T12:28:03.187615+00:00","doi":"10.1038/srep43890","files":[{"bucket":"20690a2f-7fe9-46e4-95d9-bc67a5f266e2","checksum":"md5:39ee4c2cccc32c5ca88eeb912bfd4ca5","key":"Weyhenmeyer_Nature_17.pdf","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/20690a2f-7fe9-46e4-95d9-bc67a5f266e2/Weyhenmeyer_Nature_17.pdf"},"size":860793,"type":"pdf"}],"id":818630,"links":{"badge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.1038/srep43890.svg","bucket":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/20690a2f-7fe9-46e4-95d9-bc67a5f266e2","doi":"https://doi.org/10.1038/srep43890","html":"https://zenodo.org/record/818630","latest":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/818630","latest_html":"https://zenodo.org/record/818630","self":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/818630"},"metadata":{"access_right":"open","access_right_category":"success","communities":[{"id":"c-cascades"}],"creators":[{"affiliation":"Department of Ecology and Genetics/Limnology, Uppsala University, Norbyv\u00e4gen 18D, 752 36 Uppsala, Sweden","name":"Weyhenmeyer, Gesa A."},{"affiliation":"Science and Technology Branch, Environment and Climate Change Canada, 4905 Dufferin Str.

The students found mostly negative Tw-Ta across small ponds, lakes, streams/rivers and the sea shore (i.e. downward QH), with Tw-Ta becoming increasingly negative with increasing Ta. Further examination of Tw-Ta using high-frequency temperature data from inland waters across the globe confirmed that Tw-Ta is linearly related to Ta. Using the longest available high-frequency temperature time series from Lake Erken, Sweden, we found a rapid increase in the occasions of negative Tw-Ta with increasing annual mean Ta since 1989.

The project has been making a considerable contribution to the collection and sharing of bird observations, even in the data-poorest countries, and is accelerating the accumulation of bird records globally. On 22 March 2018 eBird surpassed \u00bd billion bird observations.</p>\n  <p>A primary component of ensuring the best quality data is the network of more than 1300 volunteer reviewers who scour incoming data for accuracy. Reviewers provide active feedback to participants on everything from bird identification to best practices for data collection. Since eBird's inception in 2002, almost 23 million observations have been reviewed, requiring more than 190,000 hours of effort by reviewers. In this presentation we review how eBird recruits expert reviewers, describe their responsibilities, and offer some insight in new developments to improve the reviewing process.</p>\n  <p><b>How are reviewers recruited.</b> There are three primary methods that used to identify new reviewers. First, if we don't have any active participants in a region (e.g., Kamchatka Russia) eBird staff search birding listserves to find an individual who is reporting a lot of high-quality observations from the area. We then contact those individuals and offer them the opportunity to review records for the region. This option has the lowest likelihood of success. Second, if an individual is submitting a lot of records to eBird from a region that needs a reviewer we contact them and request their participation. Third, in much of the world eBird has partner groups. These partner organizations (e.g., Taiwan, Spain, India, Portugal, Australia, and all of the Western Hemisphere) recruit their own reviewers. The third method is the most effective way to gain expert participation.</p>\n  <p><b>What does a reviewer do</b>? eBird reviewers work to improve eBird data in three primary areas. First, they develop and manage the eBird checklist filters for a region. These filters generate a checklist of birds for a particular time and location, and determine what records get flagged for further review. Second, if an eBird participant tries to report a species that is not on the checklist, or if the number of individuals of a species exceeds the filter limit, then these records get flagged for review. Reviewers contact the observer and request further documentation. Currently, 57% of all records that are evaluated by reviewers are validated. Finally, eBird reviewers validate whether the participant is eBirding correctly. That is, are they correctly filling out the information on when, where, and how they went birding. It has been our experience that different types of reviewers are required to effectively review eBird submissions: those who are good at reviewing bird records and those who are good at educating observers on how to participate.</p>\n  <p><b>What are future plans</b>? eBird will move towards more effective reviewer teams, where the volume of observations can be split amongst a number of individuals with different strengths, allowing identification experts to focus on observation-level ID issues; and strong communicators to focus on working with contributors on checklist-level best practices. Currently, a single eBird review platform handles a broad array of different reviewing functions. It is our intent to split some of these functions into multiple platforms. For example, right now all review happens at the database level of the 'observation': a record of a taxon at a date and location. Plans are underway to develop tools that will allow reviewers to work at the entire checklist level (i.e., to more easily review the accuracy of how all the observations during a checklist event were submitted), which will enable much more effective review of checklist-level data quality concerns.</p>","doi":"10.3897/biss.2.25394","imprint":{"publisher":"Pensoft Publishers"},"journal":{"issue":"","pages":"e25394","title":"Biodiversity Information Science and Standards","volume":"2"},"keywords":["eBird","data quality","citizen science","data review"],"license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"publication_date":"2018-05-17","relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1252570"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1252569"}}]},"resource_type":{"subtype":"article","title":"Journal article","type":"publication"},"title":"Improving Data Quality in eBird- the Expert Reviewer Network"},"owners":[1161],"revision":3,"stats":{"downloads":15.0,"unique_downloads":15.0,"unique_views":9.0,"version_downloads":15.0,"version_unique_downloads":15.0,"version_unique_views":9.0,"version_views":9.0,"version_volume":990225.0,"views":9.0,"volume":990225.0},"updated":"2019-04-09T13:46:47.978084+00:00"},{"conceptrecid":"1140608","created":"2018-01-09T13:57:30.204787+00:00","doi":"10.3897/tdwgproceedings.1.20400","files":[{"bucket":"1fcc211a-14fe-421c-a618-cc8c8d1bfbdd","checksum":"md5:495260315c5962be2168dab53abc2c30","key":"BISS_article_20400.pdf","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/1fcc211a-14fe-421c-a618-cc8c8d1bfbdd/BISS_article_20400.pdf"},"size":94222,"type":"pdf"},{"bucket":"1fcc211a-14fe-421c-a618-cc8c8d1bfbdd","checksum":"md5:c02fcc77514373f58a3ee43380a6094a","key":"BISS_article_20400.xml","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/1fcc211a-14fe-421c-a618-cc8c8d1bfbdd/BISS_article_20400.xml"},"size":18564,"type":"xml"}],"id":1140609,"links":{"badge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.3897/tdwgproceedings.1.20400.svg","bucket":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/1fcc211a-14fe-421c-a618-cc8c8d1bfbdd","doi":"https://doi.org/10.3897/tdwgproceedings.1.20400","html":"https://zenodo.org/record/1140609","latest":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/1140609","latest_html":"https://zenodo.org/record/1140609","self":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/1140609"},"metadata":{"access_right":"open","access_right_category":"success","communities":[{"id":"biosyslit"}],"creators":[{"affiliation":"Ecole Polytechnique, Palaiseau, France","name":"Zhu, Yue"},{"affiliation":"UPMC Paris 6 - Sorbonne Universit\u00e9s -- LIP6, Paris, France","name":"Durand, Thibaut"},{"affiliation":"IRD, Paris, France","name":"Chenin, Eric"},{"affiliation":"Institut de Syst\u00e9matique, \u00c9volution, Biodiversit\u00e9 ISYEB - UMR 7205 \u2013 CNRS, MNHN, UPMC, EPHE Mus\u00e9um national d'Histoire naturelle, Sorbonne Universit\u00e9s, Paris, France","name":"Pignal, Marc"},{"affiliation":"UPMC Paris 6 - Sorbonne Universit\u00e9s -- LIP6, Paris, France","name":"Gallinari, Patrick"},{"affiliation":"Institut de Syst\u00e9matique, \u00c9volution, Biodiversit\u00e9 ISYEB - UMR 7205 \u2013 CNRS, MNHN, UPMC, EPHE UPMC Univ.

However, ecological or morphological traits describing specimens are rarely recorded while gathering data. \u00a0This lack limits queries and analyses. Manual tagging of millions of specimens will be a huge task even with the help of citizen science projects such as \"les herbonautes\"\u00a0(<u>http://lesherbonautes.mnhn.fr</u>). On the other hand, deep learning methods that use convolutional neural networks (CNN) demonstrate their efficiency in various domains, such as computer vision (Krizhevsky et al. 2012,\u00a0Azizpour et al. 2016), speech recognition (Abdel-Hamid et al. 2014) or face identification (Li et al. 2015,\u00a0Freytag et al. 2016).</p>\n  <p>We aim to use deep learning to provide a visual representation of words used to describe plants (e.g. <em>simple</em>, or <em>compound</em> leaf), and to associate those words with\u00a0specimens in the Paris herbarium. \u00a0This will provide a semantic description of each of the 7 millions images of the fully digitized collection of the Paris herbarium in the Mus\u00e9um National d'Histoire Naturelle (MNHN, Paris, France). In a proof of concept project, we have used a CNN\u00a0- pre-trained on the image database ImageNet (http://www.image-net.org) - in order to identify 4 morphological traits of leaves, using 103,000 herbarium images from 11 different taxa: margin (entire / dentate), leaf attachment (opposite / alternate), leaf organization (simple / compound), plant (woody / non-woody) (see\u00a0Fig. 1)\u00a0Seventy percent of images are used to train the weights of the model (in a supervised learning process that uses a training set already tagged for the 4 characteristics), 10% are used as validation set to tune the hyper-parameters of the model and to avoid overfitting, and 20% are used as test set to evaluate the generalization performances of\u00a0the final neural network. The first results are encouraging with over 80%\u00a0success on the test set. In a second step, we test if the neural network is not overfitting the training examples, and can generalize\u00a0to new taxa. If we restrict the training set to a small number of taxa (4 taxa containing 76% of images), the success rate\u00a0on the 7 other\u00a0taxa (unseen during training) decreases drastically.\u00a0A good sampling of the taxonomic diversity of plants appears crucial to train the neural network. A second method visualizes the area of each image that was detected by the CNN as the most important for morphological character recognition (Durand et al. 2017). This method provides an explanatory view of the automatic recognition process. In this poster we describe methods and results on botanical images for the different taxa. We discuss perspectives on image tagging of the Paris herbarium, and how to combine the citizen science project in order to annotate images with CNN automatic image description.</p>","doi":"10.3897/tdwgproceedings.1.20400","imprint":{"publisher":"Pensoft Publishers"},"journal":{"issue":"","pages":"e20400","title":"Biodiversity Information Science and Standards","volume":"1"},"keywords":["Deep learning","convolutionnal neural network","herbarium","image","morphology"],"license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"publication_date":"2017-08-18","relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1140609"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1140608"}}]},"resource_type":{"subtype":"article","title":"Journal article","type":"publication"},"title":"Using a Deep Convolutional Neural Network for Extracting Morphological Traits from Herbarium Images"},"owners":[1161],"revision":4,"stats":{"downloads":11.0,"unique_downloads":11.0,"unique_views":3.0,"version_downloads":11.0,"version_unique_downloads":11.0,"version_unique_views":3.0,"version_views":3.0,"version_volume":1036442.0,"views":3.0,"volume":1036442.0},"updated":"2019-04-09T13:26:54.798011+00:00"},{"conceptrecid":"899066","created":"2017-09-21T06:41:38.276942+00:00","doi":"10.3897/natureconservation.20.12704","files":[{"bucket":"bc727530-7967-486f-b10c-0a0c597bb589","checksum":"md5:e203b779148b277aca450b3654526761","key":"NC_article_12704.pdf","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/bc727530-7967-486f-b10c-0a0c597bb589/NC_article_12704.pdf"},"size":1430895,"type":"pdf"},{"bucket":"bc727530-7967-486f-b10c-0a0c597bb589","checksum":"md5:668648e906d5509281e344830dae8f67","key":"NC_article_12704.xml","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/bc727530-7967-486f-b10c-0a0c597bb589/NC_article_12704.xml"},"size":226052,"type":"xml"}],"id":899067,"links":{"badge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.3897/natureconservation.20.12704.svg","bucket":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/bc727530-7967-486f-b10c-0a0c597bb589","doi":"https://doi.org/10.3897/natureconservation.20.12704","html":"https://zenodo.org/record/899067","latest":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/899067","latest_html":"https://zenodo.org/record/899067","self":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/899067"},"metadata":{"access_right":"open","access_right_category":"success","communities":[{"id":"biosyslit"}],"creators":[{"affiliation":"Centro Nazionale per lo Studio e la Conservazione della Biodiversit\u00e0 Forestale Carabinieri \"Bosco Fontana\", Verona, Italy","name":"Campanaro, Alessandro"},{"affiliation":"Centro Nazionale per lo Studio e la Conservazione della Biodiversit\u00e0 Forestale Carabinieri \"Bosco Fontana\", Verona, Italy","name":"Hardersen, S\u00f6nke"},{"affiliation":"Centro Nazionale per lo Studio e la Conservazione della Biodiversit\u00e0 Forestale Carabinieri \"Bosco Fontana\", Verona, Italy","name":"Redolfi De Zan, Lara"},{"affiliation":"Universit\u00e0 di Roma \"La Sapienza\", Roma, Italy","name":"Antonini, Gloria"},{"affiliation":"Centro Nazionale per lo Studio e la Conservazione della Biodiversit\u00e0 Forestale Carabinieri \"Bosco Fontana\", Verona, Italy","name":"Bardiani, Marco"},{"affiliation":"Consiglio per la ricerca in agricoltura e l'analisi dell'economia agraria, Firenze, Italy","name":"Maura, Michela"},{"affiliation":"Consiglio per la ricerca in agricoltura e l'analisi dell'economia agraria, Firenze, Italy","name":"Maurizi, Emanuela"},{"affiliation":"Consiglio per la ricerca in agricoltura e l'analisi dell'economia agraria, Firenze, Italy","name":"Mosconi, Fabio"},{"affiliation":"Consiglio per la ricerca in agricoltura e l'analisi dell'economia agraria, Firenze, Italy","name":"Zauli, Agnese"},{"affiliation":"Universit\u00e0 Roma Tre, Roma, Italy","name":"Bologna, Marco Alberto"},{"affiliation":"Consiglio per la ricerca in agricoltura e l'analisi dell'economia agraria, Firenze, Italy","name":"Roversi, Pio Federico"},{"affiliation":"Consiglio per la ricerca in agricoltura e l'analisi dell'economia agraria, Firenze, Italy","name":"Sabbatini Peverieri, Giuseppino"},{"affiliation":"Centro Nazionale per lo Studio e la Conservazione della Biodiversit\u00e0 Forestale Carabinieri \"Bosco Fontana\", Verona, Italy","name":"Mason, Franco"}],"description":"<p>Citizen science, the engagement of people in a research project, has grown rapidly in recent years, also for mapping of species of conservation interest. The Life Project \"Monitoring Insects with Public Participation\" (MIPP) actively promoted collaboration amongst scientists, public administrations and citizens in the collection of occurrence data of nine insect species listed in the Habitats Directive: Lucanus cervus, Osmoderma eremita, Cerambyx cerdo, Rosalia alpina, Morimus asper/funereus, Lopinga achine, Parnassius apollo, Zerynthia cassandra/polyxena and Saga pedo. These species were selected because they share two main characteristics: (i) they are listed in Annexes II and IV of the Habitats Directive and (ii) they are large and relatively easy to identify. From 2014 to 2016, many different strategies were applied to contact and engage the public and approximately 14,000 citizens were reached directly. Additionally, printed and online material informed the public about this project. Citizens could transmit data on the target species, accompanied by a photograph, via the web-site of the project or through a dedicated application (app) for smartphones and tablets. All records were validated by experts based on the photographs sent by citizens. A total number of 2,308 records were transmitted and 1,691 (73.2%) of these were confirmed. Most of the reports were submitted via the website, although the submission via the app increased over time. The species most commonly recorded was L. cervus, followed by M. asper/funereus and R. alpina. Data collected by citizen scientists allowed a detailed analysis to be made on altitudinal distribution and phenology of the species and the results obtained were compared with literature data on altitudinal distribution and phenology. For example, for L. cervus, 67% of the records collected were from the altitudinal range 0\u2013400 m a.s.l. Interestingly, the data showed that the phenology of this species changed with altitude.</p>","doi":"10.3897/natureconservation.20.12704","imprint":{"publisher":"Pensoft Publishers"},"journal":{"issue":"","pages":"265-297","title":"Nature Conservation","volume":"20"},"keywords":["Citizen Science","Habitats Directive","Phenology","Altitudinal distribution"],"license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"publication_date":"2017-08-28","relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"899067"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"899066"}}]},"resource_type":{"subtype":"article","title":"Journal article","type":"publication"},"title":"Analyses of occurrence data of protected insect species collected by citizens in Italy"},"owners":[1161],"revision":4,"stats":{"downloads":11.0,"unique_downloads":11.0,"unique_views":4.0,"version_downloads":11.0,"version_unique_downloads":11.0,"version_unique_views":4.0,"version_views":4.0,"version_volume":15739845.0,"views":4.0,"volume":15739845.0},"updated":"2019-03-20T22:01:11.497270+00:00"},{"conceptrecid":"2581866","created":"2019-03-02T12:03:55.695534+00:00","doi":"10.1007/s10531-017-1492-8","files":[{"bucket":"cf9c1f01-709d-41e0-9c57-dee3d37ab0f0","checksum":"md5:01dc71d446be7a9355f575b4e2a3ff81","key":"Di Camillo et al 2017.pdf","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/cf9c1f01-709d-41e0-9c57-dee3d37ab0f0/Di%20Camillo%20et%20al%202017.pdf"},"size":3366684,"type":"pdf"}],"id":2581867,"links":{"badge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.1007/s10531-017-1492-8.svg","bucket":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/cf9c1f01-709d-41e0-9c57-dee3d37ab0f0","doi":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10531-017-1492-8","html":"https://zenodo.org/record/2581867","latest":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/2581867","latest_html":"https://zenodo.org/record/2581867","self":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/2581867"},"metadata":{"access_right":"open","access_right_category":"success","alternate_identifiers":[{"identifier":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10531-017-1492-8","scheme":"url"}],"communities":[{"id":"greenbubbles"}],"creators":[{"affiliation":"Department of Life  and Environmental Sciences Marche Polytechnic University, CoNISMa, Ancona, Italy","name":"Di Camillo, Cristina Gioia"},{"affiliation":"Department of Biological, Geological and Environmental Sciences and Interdepartmental Research Centre for Environmental Sciences, University of Bologna, CoNISMa, Ravenna, Italy","name":"Ponti, Massimo"},{"affiliation":"Department of Earth, Environment and Life SciencesUniversity of Genoa, CoNISMa, Genoa, Italy","name":"Bavestrello, Giorgio"},{"affiliation":"Department of Marine Studies, University of Split, Split, Croatia","name":"Krzelj, Maja"},{"affiliation":"Department of Life  and Environmental Sciences Marche Polytechnic University, CoNISMa, Ancona, Italy","name":"Cerrano, Carlo"}],"description":"<p>In the Mediterranean, habitat-forming corals often characterize essential fish habitats. While their distribution is sufficiently known for the western basin, few data are available from the Central-Eastern Mediterranean Sea (CEM). This study fills this gap supplying the largest dataset ever built on the geographical and bathymetric distribution of the most relevant habitat-forming corals (<em>Eunicella cavolini</em>, <em>Eunicella verrucosa</em>, <em>Eunicella singularis</em>, <em>Leptogorgia sarmentosa</em>, <em>Paramuricea clavata</em>, <em>Corallium rubrum</em> and <em>Savalia savaglia</em>) of the CEM. Information collected from different sources such as literature, citizen science, and from the World Wide Web (WWW) was combined. Videos published on the WWW provided additional information on the presence of fishing lines and signs of damage, as well as on the distribution of purple and yellow-purple colonies of <em>Paramuricea clavata</em>. The study highlighted the impressive amount of information that the WWW can offer to scientists, termed here as Web Ecological Knowledge (WEK). The WEK is constantly fuelled by internauts, representing a free, refreshable, long-term exploitable reservoir of information. A quick and easy method to retrieve data from the WWW was illustrated. In addition, the distribution of corals was overlapped to marine protected areas and to the distribution of environmental conditions suitable for coralligenous habitats, fragile biogenic Mediterranean structures hosting complex assemblages in need of strict protection. The collected data allowed identifying priority areas with high species diversity and sites that are impacted by fishing activities. Supplied data can correctly address conservation and restoration policies in the CEM, adding an important contribution to ecosystem-based marine spatial planning.</p>","doi":"10.1007/s10531-017-1492-8","grants":[{"acronym":"MERCES","code":"689518","funder":{"acronyms":["EC"],"doi":"10.13039/501100000780","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/funders/10.13039/501100000780"},"name":"European Commission"},"links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/grants/10.13039/501100000780::689518"},"program":"H2020","title":"Marine Ecosystem Restoration in Changing European Seas"},{"acronym":"GreenBubbles","code":"643712","funder":{"acronyms":["EC"],"doi":"10.13039/501100000780","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/funders/10.13039/501100000780"},"name":"European Commission"},"links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/grants/10.13039/501100000780::643712"},"program":"H2020","title":"Green Bubbles RISE for sustainable diving"}],"journal":{"issue":"5","pages":"1257-1276","title":"Biodiversity and Conservation","volume":"27"},"keywords":["Biogeography","Citizen Science","Foundation species","Mesophotic habitats","Social media","European Union (EU)","Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions","Grant Agreement No 643712","Green Bubbles RISE for sustainable diving","Green Bubbles"],"license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"notes":"This is a post-peer-review, pre-copyedit version of an article published in Biodiversity and Conservation on 23 December 2017 (First Online).

The evidence reinforces the idea of community social capital, with caregivers and professionals playing a leading role. Yet, the cost of collective action is mainly supported by individuals with a mental condition - which unveils their vulnerability. The results are in general agreement with previous findings but, since we broaden the perspective of previous studies, we are also able to find marked differences in the social behavior of certain groups of mental disorders.

In the XIXth century the number of Heteroptera species records from the present territory of Poland increased rapidly, mainly due to the faunistic studies by both, German (Weigel 1806; Schilling 1827, 1837; Gravenhorst 1836; Siebold 1839; Scholtz 1847; Schramm 1848; Assmann 1854) and Polish (Gorski 1852; Waga 1857; Nowicki 1864, 1865, 1867, 1868, 1870a, b; \u0141omnicki 1882; Stobiecki 1883; Kotula 1890) entomologists. Till the end of the XIXth century, 438 species of terrestrial Heteroptera have been recorded from the present territory of Poland; all those records are presented in the Fig. 1. In the first half of the twentieth century, faunistic studies on the terrestrial Heteroptera in Poland have also been conducted predominantly by German entomologists (Kuhlgatz 1901, Enderlein 1906, Stichel 1923, Laske 1928, Schmidt 1928, Gruhl 1929, Scholz 1931, Schubert 1934, Karl 1935, Engel i Hedicke 1936, Michalk 1936, Pax 1937, Lanzke i Polentz 1942), but papers by the Polish authors have also been published (Smreczy\u0144ski 1906, Szulczewski 1908, Stobiecki 1915, Krasucki 1916, Tenenbaum 1921, Strawi\u0144ski 1926, Ruszkowski 1933, Obarski 1938). Till 1945 the number of Heteroptera species recorded from the present territory of Poland increased to 578 with many new records from the regions not studied before (Fig. 2). In the second half of the XXth century the first keys for the identification of Polish Heteroptera (Wr&oacute;blewski 1968; Cmoluchowa 1978), and the first comprehensive faunistic reviews of several true-bugs families (Lis J.A. 1990a, b) have been published what had a great impact on further development of faunistic studies in Poland. The XXth century has ended with 673 species of terrestrial Heteroptera recorded from Poland, and the number of known Polish records has doubled in comparison to the year 1945 (till that year we have about 9 800 records, whereas till the end of the XXth century &ndash; about 18&nbsp;400 records: see Fig. 3 and Fig. 5). The beginning of the XXI century brings the data growth of further 11&nbsp;000 records (Fig. 4) and several species recorded in our country for the first time (Fig. 6). At present, the best investigated regions are, as follows: several cities and their surroundings (Cracow, Wroc\u0142aw, Bytom, Pozna\u0144, Przemy\u015bl, Zwierzyniec, Pu\u0142awy), Bia\u0142owie\u017ca Primeval Forest, Ojc&oacute;w National Park, Pieniny Mountains, Gorce Mountains, Bukowa G&oacute;ra reserve, and Bielinek on the Odra River reserve (Fig. 7). However, only 3% of the territory of Poland are very well studied, since only in 82 UTM squares (out of almost 3400) at least 100 Heteroptera species have been recorded, so far. Moreover, at least one species has been recorded in 1200 UTM squares (it is about one third of the Polish UTM squares). Although faunistic studies are very important from many points of view and are the basis for zoocenology, zoogeography, or phylogeography, their traditions in Poland are not as well established as in other European countries. Comprehensive nature of such studies, including a necessity of involving many specialists and the lack of time and resources to cover the entire country area, makes them not very popular in Poland. Therefore, the citizen science initiatives in Polish Heteroptera defined as &ldquo;the collection and analysis of data by non-professional entomologists as part of a collaborative project with professional scientists&rdquo; would be a great opportunity to gather more new faunistic data from our country. Moreover, the citizen science would be also very important in early detection of alien Heteroptera pest species introduced to our country.</p>","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.2550100","journal":{"pages":"1-8","title":"Heteroptera Poloniae - Acta Faunistica","volume":"13"},"keywords":["Hemiptera","Heteroptera","true-bugs","faunistics","distribution","Poland"],"language":"pol","license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"publication_date":"2019-01-28","related_identifiers":[{"identifier":"10.5281/zenodo.2550099","relation":"isVersionOf","scheme":"doi"}],"relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"2550100"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"2550099"}}]},"resource_type":{"subtype":"article","title":"Journal article","type":"publication"},"title":"Badania faunistyczne nad l\u0105dowymi pluskwiakami r\u00f3\u017cnoskrzyd\u0142ymi (Hemiptera: Heteroptera) w Polsce: rys historyczny i perspektywy [Faunistic researches on terrestrial true-bugs (Hemiptera: Heteroptera) in Poland: a historical background and perspectives]"},"owners":[54262],"revision":3,"stats":{"downloads":38.0,"unique_downloads":36.0,"unique_views":39.0,"version_downloads":38.0,"version_unique_downloads":36.0,"version_unique_views":39.0,"version_views":43.0,"version_volume":53922684.0,"views":43.0,"volume":53922684.0},"updated":"2019-04-10T03:23:47.172564+00:00"},{"conceptrecid":"3251256","created":"2019-06-21T04:33:00.468188+00:00","doi":"10.3897/biss.3.36153","files":[{"bucket":"c2e72aaf-c145-4bc7-86c5-fd6b2dc7d38a","checksum":"md5:84b6a8d5df4b7183f709cae483f4b8de","key":"BISS_article_36153.pdf","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/c2e72aaf-c145-4bc7-86c5-fd6b2dc7d38a/BISS_article_36153.pdf"},"size":75401,"type":"pdf"},{"bucket":"c2e72aaf-c145-4bc7-86c5-fd6b2dc7d38a","checksum":"md5:296e665b8f0c5f6eb87e002be02434df","key":"BISS_article_36153.xml","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/c2e72aaf-c145-4bc7-86c5-fd6b2dc7d38a/BISS_article_36153.xml"},"size":14305,"type":"xml"}],"id":3251257,"links":{"badge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.3897/biss.3.36153.svg","bucket":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/c2e72aaf-c145-4bc7-86c5-fd6b2dc7d38a","doi":"https://doi.org/10.3897/biss.3.36153","html":"https://zenodo.org/record/3251257","latest":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/3251257","latest_html":"https://zenodo.org/record/3251257","self":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/3251257"},"metadata":{"access_right":"open","access_right_category":"success","communities":[{"id":"biosyslit"}],"creators":[{"affiliation":"University of Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal","name":"Dias da Silva, Ana Margarida"},{"affiliation":"Science Museum of the University of Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal|Centre for Functional Ecology, Department of Life Sciences, University of Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal","name":"Gir\u00e3o da Cruz, M.

At the University of Coimbra\u00a0(UC), the Life Sciences Department safeguards almost 5000 letters and other documentation addressed to directors, gardeners and other collaborators of the Botanic Garden.

Received correspondence is a great resource for understanding the process of knowledge creation and circulation in the plant sciences, including botany and agriculture, as well as the scientific colonial practices and their implication for the amassing of biological collections at the UC.</p>\n  <p>In order to uncover historical biodiversity data within this archival material, we have implemented <em>Plant Letters </em>(<u>https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/catedraunesco/plant-letters</u>), a citizen science transcription project that seeks to uncover the stories within these historical archives, the tales of travelers and scientists, on the quest of recording of the world's diversity, mostly in the Portuguese ex-colonies in sub-Saharan Africa. Using the collaborative platform Zooniverse (<u>https://www.zooniverse.org)</u>, users are requested to engage with the archive and transcribe mostly handwritten letters in several languages, giving dimension to our continuous efforts of promoting open and widespread access to information. The project invites everyone to transcribe handwritten or typed letters received by the Botanic Garden between about 1870 and 1928, from more than 1100 correspondents from around the world.</p>\n  <p>The main purpose of this project is to track plant species, locations and scientists in the correspondence received in the 19<sup>th</sup> and 20<sup>th</sup> centuries at the Botanic Garden of the University of Coimbra. To do so, <em>Plant Letters</em> seeks in users, both experts or simply curious, a source of participation in the construction of knowledge, making use of collective intelligence, in a lively exchange of information, experiences and knowledge.</p>\n  <p>In transcribing the letters, we want to retrieve information that can include:</p>\n  <ul>\n    inquiries and doubts about plant classification and taxonomy;\n    historical plant species locations, distribution records and abundance;\n    biological material circulation (plant and seed exchanges);\n    track the path of herbarium and museum specimens in our collections;\n    unravel networks of botanical knowledge.\n  </ul>\n  <p>Transcribing the information contained in these documents will allow us to: track plant specimens as they travelled from their native countries to the scientists who named them; to determine historical plant locations in parts of sub-Saharan Africa; to better understand the scientific processes of plant discovery, taxonomy and botany;\u00a0and\u00a0to collect information that gives context to biological specimens in museum objects and other natural history collections. All of these data, valuable to the present and future conservation of tropical flora, will be made available, bearing in mind the open science principles.</p>","doi":"10.3897/biss.3.36153","imprint":{"publisher":"Pensoft Publishers"},"journal":{"issue":"","pages":"e36153","title":"Biodiversity Information Science and

scope</strong></p>\n\n<p>Member State authorities are required to report on the distribution in their territory of each of the invasive alien species (IAS) of Union concern. These are species with documented biodiversity impacts sensu the European Union Regulation on the prevention and management of the introduction and spread of Invasive Alien Species in Europe (IAS Regulation No 1143/2014) (European Union 2014). This distribution represents the official reporting under Article 24(1) of R.1143/2014 on invasive alien species for the period 2015&ndash;2018. Baseline distribution of these species has previously been reported and published (Adriaens et al. 2018, ).</p>\n\n<p>Data were compiled from various datasets holding invasive species observations such as data from research institutes and research projects (9%), citizen science observatories (68%) and a range of other sources (23%) such as&nbsp;governmental agencies, water managers etc. More specifically the dataset includes:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>The citizen science recording portals www.waarnemingen.be and www.observation.be which has a specific alert system for IAS where nature volunteers can report their observations (Adriaens et al. 2018);</li>\n\t<li>Data from the Research Institute for Nature and Forest (INBO), the Flemish government institute that coordinates N2000, WFD and BIrd Directive and IAS monitoring in the terrestrial, estuarine and freshwater environment;</li>\n\t<li>Data from the Flemish Environment Agency which performs management of muskrat and invasive water plants in Flanders, gathered with a dedicated smartphone app since 2015;</li>\n\t<li>Data from the Flemish provinces and Rato vzw that manage water plants, muskrat, giant hogweed etc.;</li>\n\t<li>Some smaller datasets from cities;</li>\n\t<li>Data from the Brussels Capital Region from the Brussels Environment data portal;</li>\n\t<li>Plant inventories of the &lsquo;contrats de rivi&egrave;re&rsquo; along watercourses in Wallonia, making use of a dedicated application to collect data directly from the field (fulcrum);</li>\n\t<li>The government reporting portals for IAS of the &lsquo;Observatoire wallon de la flore, de la faune et des habitats (Service Public de Wallonie)&rsquo;;</li>\n\t<li>Some validated data from specific datasets on gbif (iNaturalist, Natusfera, Naturgucker).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Data were normalized using a custom mapping of the original data files to Darwin Core (Wieczorek et al. 2012) where possible. Species names were mapped to the GBIF Backbone Taxonomy (GBIF 2016) using the species API (http://www.gbif.org/developer/species). The mapping was assisted by dedicated software (SMARTIE) which was specifically written for the purpose of aggregating IAS data from various sources. Appropriate selection of records was performed based on the cut-off dates (see data range) and record content validation (see validation procedure). Data were then joined with GRID10k layer Belgium based on GRID10k cellcodes (ETRS_1989_LAEA).&nbsp;The technical format is in line with the <a href=\"http://cdr.eionet.europa.eu/help/ias_regulation/material/IAS-species-distribution-user-manual\">guidelines</a> provided to the member states for the compilation of reports on Species Distribution (SD) of Invasive Alien Species of Union concern.</p>\n\n<p><strong>File description</strong></p>\n\n<p>The dataset contains a shapefiles (<em>T1_Belgium_Union_List_Species.shp</em>) with the distribution of the species of Union Concern at 10km<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;(European Terrestrial Reference System projection - 1989 ETRS_1989_LAEA) level. The attributes table contains <em>Cellcode </em>(ETRS<sup>&nbsp;</sup>grid cell code)&nbsp;and <em>Species </em>(scientific name + authority).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Date range</strong></p>\n\n<p>The data reflects the distribution of the IAS of Union concern in Belgium in the first reporting period for the EU Regulation hence comprises observations of Union List invasive species between January 2015 (2015-01-01) and December 2018 (2018-12-31).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Validation procedure</strong></p>\n\n<p>Record validation was performed to exclude dubious records, wrong identifications etc. This was done based on the IdentificationVerificationStatus field (to which validation information from original data were mapped) if available. In general, non-validated data were not considered. Data were validated in the original datasets based on evidence (e.g. pictures), on the observer&rsquo;s experience, or based on a set of predefined rules (e.g. automated validation based on geographic filtering). Data from research institutes were generally considered validated. A few casual records of EU list species that were clearly planted were discarded manually. When the original dataset did not mention any validation status, records were not considered validated and therefore not taken into account&nbsp;unless for Chinese mitten crab&nbsp;<em>Eriocheir sinensis</em>, ruddy duck&nbsp;<em>Oxyura jamaicensis</em>, raccoon&nbsp;<em>Procyon lotor</em>, Siberian ground squirrel&nbsp;<em>Tamias sibiricus</em>, sacred ibis&nbsp;<em>Threskiornis aethiopicus</em>, Egyptian goose&nbsp;<em>Alopochen aegyptiaca,&nbsp;</em>Himalayan balsam&nbsp;<em>Impatiens glandulifera</em>,&nbsp;giant hogweed&nbsp;<em>Heracleum mantegazzianum,&nbsp;</em>muskrat&nbsp;<em>Ondatra zibethicus&nbsp;</em>and red-eared slider&nbsp;<em>Trachemys spp</em>. For these species, it was assumed all records were correct as they originate from dedicated sampling (<em>E. sinensis</em>) within research projects, were gathered by public bodies (e.g. muskrat), or represent species that are readily recognizable by people in the field. Data provided by EASIN in the care package and GBIF data were carefully checked.</p>\n\n<p>A visual check was performed on the resulting distribution maps by representatives of the Belgian national scientific council on invasive alien species, an official consultative structure coordinating scientific input and data aggregation between Belgian regions and institutions with regards to technical implementation of the Regulation No 1143/2014 on invasive alien species.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Data providers</strong></p>\n\n<p>The providers of the invasive species data for this exercise (individuals and their respective organizations) are listed in the &quot;data providers&quot; section of the dataset metadata. Much of the primary occurrence data that formed the basis for this aggregated dataset will be published as open data on the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF).</p>","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.3060173","keywords":["biodiversity","invasive alien species","biological invasions","distribution","Europe","Regulation","EASIN","Belgium"],"language":"eng","license":{"id":"CC0-1.0"},"publication_date":"2019-05-20","references":["Adriaens, T. et al.

The overarching objective of SSNet is to advance knowledge on the role of small streams in water quality, biodiversity and ecosystem services protection that will inform policy, measures and management options to meet water quality and other resources protection targets. The project will start with a synthesis of available information on the importance of small streams to initiate communication with stakeholders and introduce the project. This will be followed by a compilation and analysis of existing data on small streams in Ireland to inform the selection of sites for the proposed research. Three work packages will collect new data on hydrochemistry with a focus on the nutrient retention potential of headwater streams, hydromorphology and biodiversity. All three investigations will share common sites to enable interconnections between the three elements to be explored and provide an integrated approach to the research. Modelling based on the results from each of the aforementioned tasks will be used to estimate the level of intervention in the small stream network required to have measurable effects throughout a catchment on both water quality (N, P &amp; sediment) and flows, and overall delivery/maintenance of ecosystem services. We will also engage volunteers in both biological water quality and hydromorphological assessments and evaluate the potential of citizen science in facilitating greater monitoring coverage of the

However, these data are not available even for the world\u2019s most notorious invasive species. Here we introduce the Global Garlic Mustard Field Survey, a coordinated distributed field survey to collect performance data and germplasm from a single invasive species: garlic mustard (<i>Alliaria petiolata</i>) across its entire distribution using minimal resources. We chose this species for its ecological impacts, prominence in ecological studies of invasion success, simple life history, and several genetic and life history attributes that make it amenable to experimental study. We developed a standardised field survey protocol to estimate population size (area) and density, age structure, plant size and fecundity, as well as damage by herbivores and pathogens in each population, and to collect representative seed samples. Across four years and with contributions from 164 academic and non-academic participants from 16 countries in North America and Europe thus far, we have collected 45,788 measurements and counts of 137,811 plants from 383 populations and seeds from over 5,000 plants. All field data and seed resources will be curated for release to the scientific community. Our goal is to establish <i>A</i>. <i>petiolata</i> as a model species for plant invasion biology and to encourage large collaborative studies of other invasive species.</p>","doi":"10.3897/neobiota.21.5242","journal":{"issue":"","pages":"29-47","title":"NeoBiota","volume":"21"},"keywords":["Alliaria petiolata","citizen science","model system","plant invasion","research network"],"license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"publication_date":"2014-04-17","relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"574734"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"778753"}}]},"resource_type":{"subtype":"article","title":"Journal article","type":"publication"},"title":"The Global Garlic Mustard Field Survey (GGMFS): challenges and opportunities of a unique, large-scale collaboration for invasion biology"},"owners":[1161],"revision":5,"stats":{"downloads":2.0,"unique_downloads":2.0,"unique_views":5.0,"version_downloads":2.0,"version_unique_downloads":2.0,"version_unique_views":5.0,"version_views":5.0,"version_volume":5327912.0,"views":5.0,"volume":5327912.0},"updated":"2019-02-18T21:20:11.480950+00:00"},{"conceptrecid":"635618","created":"2016-06-06T08:30:05+00:00","doi":"10.3897/zookeys.585.8019","files":[{"bucket":"7e55941e-a394-4adc-b54e-9ec9f276013b","checksum":"md5:4de67bd6e0c2cd6872f9c8482cfd141d","key":"ZK_article_8019.xml","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/7e55941e-a394-4adc-b54e-9ec9f276013b/ZK_article_8019.xml"},"size":117987,"type":"xml"},{"bucket":"7e55941e-a394-4adc-b54e-9ec9f276013b","checksum":"md5:ae667231f4e8315adf4c3d085cfa1cce","key":"ZK_article_8019.pdf","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/7e55941e-a394-4adc-b54e-9ec9f276013b/ZK_article_8019.pdf"},"size":1848369,"type":"pdf"}],"id":53825,"links":{"badge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.3897/zookeys.585.8019.svg","bucket":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/7e55941e-a394-4adc-b54e-9ec9f276013b","doi":"https://doi.org/10.3897/zookeys.585.8019","html":"https://zenodo.org/record/53825","latest":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/53825","latest_html":"https://zenodo.org/record/53825","self":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/53825"},"metadata":{"access_right":"open","access_right_category":"success","communities":[{"id":"biosyslit"}],"creators":[{"affiliation":"Research Institute for Nature and Forest (INBO), Brussels, Belgium","name":"Maes, Dirk"},{"affiliation":"Natuurpunt Studie, Mechelen, Belgium","name":"Vanreusel, Wouter"},{"affiliation":"Natuurpunt Studie, Mechelen, Belgium","name":"Herremans, Marc"},{"affiliation":"Vlinderwerkgroep Natuurpunt, Mechelen, Belgium","name":"Vantieghem, Pieter"},{"affiliation":"Research Institute for Nature and Forest (INBO), Brussels, Belgium","name":"Brosens, Dimitri"},{"affiliation":"Natuurpunt Studie, Mechelen, Belgium","name":"Gielen, Karin"},{"affiliation":"Leefmilieu Brussel/BIM, Brussels, Belgium","name":"Beck, Olivier"},{"affiliation":"Universit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium","name":"Van Dyck, Hans"},{"affiliation":"Research Institute for Nature and Forest (INBO), Brussels, Belgium","name":"Desmet, Peter"},{"affiliation":"Vlinderwerkgroep Natuurpunt, Mechelen, Belgium","name":"Natuurpunt, Vlinderwerkgroep"}],"description":"<p>In this data paper, we describe two datasets derived from two sources, which collectively represent the most complete overview of butterflies in Flanders and the Brussels Capital Region (northern Belgium). The first dataset (further referred to as the INBO dataset \u2013 http://doi.org/10.15468/njgbmh) contains 761,660 records of 70 species and is compiled by the </p><p>Research Institute for Nature and Forest </p>(INBO) in cooperation with the Butterfly working group of Natuurpunt (Vlinderwerkgroep). It is derived from the database Vlinderdatabank at the INBO, which consists of (historical) collection and literature data (1830-2001), for which all butterfly specimens in institutional and available personal collections were digitized and all entomological and other relevant publications were checked for butterfly distribution data. It also contains observations and monitoring data for the period 1991-2014. The latter type were collected by a (small) butterfly monitoring network where butterflies were recorded using a standardized protocol. The second dataset (further referred to as the Natuurpunt dataset \u2013 http://doi.org/10.15468/ezfbee) contains 612,934 records of 63 species and is derived from the database http://waarnemingen.be, hosted at the nature conservation NGO Natuurpunt in collaboration with Stichting Natuurinformatie.

This present deliverable, entitled \u201cStrategies and business plan for regional and global biodiversity information infrastructures\u201d (D7.4) fits under EU BON Work Package (WP) 7 \u201cImplementation of GEO BON: strategies and solutions at European and global levels\u201d, and provides an overview of the outputs resulting from two WP7 Tasks. The objectives of this deliverable were to develop (1) a strategy for a global GEO\u00a0BON infrastructure with optimised functionality in terms of efficiency and operability (as part of Task 7.4), and (2) a business plan for sustaining the European Biodiversity Observation Network after the funded phase (as part of Task 7.5).</p>\n\n<p>Building on the outputs from other EU BON work packages and extensive consultation (including externally to the project consortium), these objectives have been met. The global and European-level map of the biodiversity informatics landscape (Task 7.4) has led to a better understanding of the landscape\u2019s current structure and functioning. This will enable key players to establish or strengthen collaborations, avoid effort duplication, and facilitate access to the biodiversity data, information and knowledge required to support effective decision-making. The business plan for the European Biodiversity Observation Network (Task 7.5) summarises what the network has to offer, to identified end-users (from policy, science/research, and citizen-science), in terms of products, tools and services, including those that can potentially generate income. A possible organisational structure, potential sources of funding, along with entry points for the network in other projects and initiatives (established or upcoming), are also presented.</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.569819","grants":[{"acronym":"EU BON","code":"308454","funder":{"acronyms":["EC"],"doi":"10.13039/501100000780","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/funders/10.13039/501100000780"},"name":"European Commission"},"links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/grants/10.13039/501100000780::308454"},"program":"FP7","title":"EU BON: Building the European Biodiversity Observation Network"}],"imprint":{"place":"Berlin","publisher":"EU BON"},"keywords":["biodiversity","business model","informatics","conservation","EU BON","GEO BON"],"license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"publication_date":"2017-03-31","relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"569819"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"797807"}}]},"resource_type":{"subtype":"report","title":"Report","type":"publication"},"title":"Deliverable 7.4 (D7.4) Strategies and business plan for regional and global  biodiversity information infrastructures"},"owners":[1161],"revision":6,"stats":{"downloads":7.0,"unique_downloads":7.0,"unique_views":23.0,"version_downloads":7.0,"version_unique_downloads":7.0,"version_unique_views":23.0,"version_views":27.0,"version_volume":11998224.0,"views":27.0,"volume":11998224.0},"updated":"2019-04-10T04:12:19.614362+00:00"},{"conceptdoi":"10.5281/zenodo.1478965","conceptrecid":"1478965","created":"2018-11-07T08:38:14.180086+00:00","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.1478966","files":[{"bucket":"b8cdae24-fe88-4273-9ae5-61bc6368738b","checksum":"md5:d1350ab04cac1ddce17c92eca33b8371","key":"classifications.csv","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/b8cdae24-fe88-4273-9ae5-61bc6368738b/classifications.csv"},"size":38845346,"type":"csv"},{"bucket":"b8cdae24-fe88-4273-9ae5-61bc6368738b","checksum":"md5:c840ed8f40550cccfc67553658aed5ac","key":"lookup_properties.csv","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/b8cdae24-fe88-4273-9ae5-61bc6368738b/lookup_properties.csv"},"size":2173564,"type":"csv"},{"bucket":"b8cdae24-fe88-4273-9ae5-61bc6368738b","checksum":"md5:d223ceac83f00cf31146b8de8e73fde2","key":"lookup_timesfits.csv","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/b8cdae24-fe88-4273-9ae5-61bc6368738b/lookup_timesfits.csv"},"size":727921,"type":"csv"},{"bucket":"b8cdae24-fe88-4273-9ae5-61bc6368738b","checksum":"md5:95ecd20356c3a2a1b7454690681b5428","key":"rankings.csv","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/b8cdae24-fe88-4273-9ae5-61bc6368738b/rankings.csv"},"size":682915,"type":"csv"},{"bucket":"b8cdae24-fe88-4273-9ae5-61bc6368738b","checksum":"md5:b38cdc00d6bc0043a93d1b74bb841936","key":"readme.md","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/b8cdae24-fe88-4273-9ae5-61bc6368738b/readme.md"},"size":6434,"type":"md"}],"id":1478966,"links":{"badge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.1478966.svg","bucket":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/b8cdae24-fe88-4273-9ae5-61bc6368738b","conceptbadge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.1478965.svg","conceptdoi":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1478965","doi":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1478966","html":"https://zenodo.org/record/1478966","latest":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/1478966","latest_html":"https://zenodo.org/record/1478966","self":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/1478966"},"metadata":{"access_right":"open","access_right_category":"success","creators":[{"name":"Higgins, P.

This enhancement is achieved by publishing\u00a0new and enriched\u00a0content to the Europeana collections platform. The use of simple vocabularies and machine-readable metadata encourages reuse and\u00a0has the additional advantage of facilitating the clustering of interesting content for user groups beyond biodiversity and natural history researchers. Linking the collections of Europe together in an openly-available platform and sharing our common cultural and natural heritage with a broad audience will increase the public's awareness of biodiversity collections.\u00a0Furthermore, it will help us reach out to new user groups such as teachers, journalists and artists, who were\u00a0previously unaware of, or distant from, our collections.</p>\n  <p>Suitable content was selected and harmonized for interlinking\u00a0with Europeana. Contributions include a large quantity of herbarium sheets, digitized glass plate negatives taken between 1880 and 1930 and a portrait collection dating from the late 19th and early 20th century. With the help of the DoeDat crowdsourcing platform, existing metadata were enriched and mobilized to allow for publication in the form of open linked data.</p>\n  <p>The integration of geographical data and common names allows the Europeana platform to link scientific specimens with literature and fine art from different collections and to guide users to interesting and inspiring content via themed virtual exhibitions.

The region possesses few biological collections within the universities and nature reserves. Still, the Department of Natural Resources pays considerable attention to the sustainable use of natural resources. On the global scale, the success of biodiversity informatics goals largely depends on the local initiatives and progress in data mobilization and sharing. Therefore, organization of regional biodiversity portals is important to promote data mobilization, education and citizen science on local scale.</p>\n  <p>Previous experience of biodiversity information systems in the region was low. The program on digitization of observations of Red Listed species was launched in 2010 under the support of the Department of Natural Resources of Yugra. The information system for Red Listed species registrations was developed through this project and currently includes about three thousand observations. Another example of digitization in Western Siberia was developed by the biological collection of Yugra State University. Its database is based on the database management system Specify and available online through its web portal (http://bioportal.ugrasu.ru). Some collections of nature reserves have their catalogues in digital form. The need of biodiversity data mobilization is well understood and is discussed at regular workshops on biological collections management held in Khanty-Mansiysk.</p>\n  <p>Recently, the biologists curating several biological collections in the region started a project on a regional biodiversity portal development (https://nwsbios.org). The portal has three major components:</p>\n  \n    the database of collections based on Specify software (http://bioportal.ugrasu.ru),\n    the metadata of different sources of biodiversity information in the region,\n    an educational platform for learning biodiversity informatics, using data published via GBIF and DwC standards.\n  \n  <p>This initiative of biodiversity data mobilization in the region includes the organization of workshops, discussions and newsletters helping to reach potential data holders and coordinate work. Through this work four different organizations from Khanty-Mansi region have registered accounts in GBIF since 2019 and started uploading data to the GBIF portal. At present there are about 25,000 observations mobilized in GBIF from the Khanty-Mansi and Yamalo-Nenets regions.</p>\n  <p>The integrated massive publishing of data in the portal will provide new opportunities for biodiversity research and sustainable management of nature resources in the northern part of West Siberia.</p>","doi":"10.3897/biss.3.37067","imprint":{"publisher":"Pensoft Publishers"},"journal":{"issue":"","pages":"e37067","title":"Biodiversity Information Science and Standards","volume":"3"},"keywords":["West Siberia","regional portal","Specify"],"license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"publication_date":"2019-07-10","relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"3340243"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"3340242"}}]},"resource_type":{"subtype":"article","title":"Journal article","type":"publication"},"title":"Biodiversity Portal of the Northern Part of West Siberia, Russia"},"owners":[1161],"revision":2,"stats":{"downloads":6.0,"unique_downloads":3.0,"unique_views":2.0,"version_downloads":6.0,"version_unique_downloads":3.0,"version_unique_views":2.0,"version_views":2.0,"version_volume":265364.0,"views":2.0,"volume":265364.0},"updated":"2019-07-18T07:05:49.586159+00:00"},{"conceptrecid":"1254701","created":"2018-05-29T04:32:03.683168+00:00","doi":"10.3897/biss.2.26514","files":[{"bucket":"d9f6b30f-a998-4cdf-8358-316583112d4e","checksum":"md5:574199c758fa7e1eeb8878ff8e4d2497","key":"BISS_article_26514.pdf","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/d9f6b30f-a998-4cdf-8358-316583112d4e/BISS_article_26514.pdf"},"size":71431,"type":"pdf"},{"bucket":"d9f6b30f-a998-4cdf-8358-316583112d4e","checksum":"md5:acb91862537a19227be03076d84349bf","key":"BISS_article_26514.xml","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/d9f6b30f-a998-4cdf-8358-316583112d4e/BISS_article_26514.xml"},"size":8843,"type":"xml"}],"id":1254702,"links":{"badge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.3897/biss.2.26514.svg","bucket":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/d9f6b30f-a998-4cdf-8358-316583112d4e","doi":"https://doi.org/10.3897/biss.2.26514","html":"https://zenodo.org/record/1254702","latest":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/1254702","latest_html":"https://zenodo.org/record/1254702","self":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/1254702"},"metadata":{"access_right":"open","access_right_category":"success","communities":[{"id":"biosyslit"}],"creators":[{"affiliation":"Meise Botanic Garden, Meise, Belgium","name":"Engledow, Henry"},{"affiliation":"Meise Botanic Garden, Meise, Belgium","name":"De Smedt, Sofie"},{"affiliation":"Meise Botanic Garden, Meise, Belgium","name":"Bogaerts, Ann"},{"affiliation":"Meise Botanic Garden, Meise, Belgium","name":"Groom, Quentin"}],"description":"<p>There are many ways to capture data from herbarium specimen labels. Here we compare the results of in-house verses out-sourced data transcription with the aim of evaluating the pros and cons of each approach and guiding future projects that want to do the same.</p>\n  <p>In 2014 Meise Botanic Garden (BR) embarked on a mass digitization project. We digitally imaged of some 1.2 million herbarium specimens from our African and Belgian Herbaria. The minimal data for a third of these images was transcribed in-house, while the remainder was out-sourced to a commercial company. The minimal data comprised the fields: specimen's herbarium location, barcode, filing name, family, collector, collector number, country code and phytoregion (for the Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda &amp; Burundi). The out-sourced data capture consisted of three types:</p>\n  \n    additional label information for central African specimens having minimal data;\n    complete data for the remaining African specimens; and,\n    species filing name information for African and Belgian specimens without minimal data. As part of the preparation for out-sourcing, a strict protocol had to be established as to the criteria for acceptable data quality levels.\n  \n  <p>Also, the creation of several lookup tables for data entry was necessary to improve data quality. During the start-up phase all the data were checked, feedback given, compromises made and the protocol amended. After this phase, an agreed upon subsample was quality controlled. If the error score exceeded the agreed level, the batch was returned for retyping. The data had three quality control checks during the process, by the data capturers, the contractor's project managers and ourselves.</p>\n  <p>Data quality was analysed and compared in-house versus out-sourced modes of data capture. The error rate by our staff versus the external company was comparable. The types of error that occurred were often linked to the specific field in question. These errors include problems of interpretation, legibility, foreign languages, typographic errors, etc. A significant amount of data cleaning and post-capture processing was required prior to import into our database, despite the data being of good quality according to protocol (error &lt; 1%). By improving the workflow and field definitions a notable improvement could be made in the \"data cleaning\" phase.</p>\n  <p>The initial motivation for capturing some data in-house was financial. However, after analysis, this may not have been the most cost effective approach. Many lessons have been learned from this first mass digitisation project that will implemented in similar projects in the future.</p>","doi":"10.3897/biss.2.26514","imprint":{"publisher":"Pensoft Publishers"},"journal":{"issue":"","pages":"e26514","title":"Biodiversity Information Science and Standards","volume":"2"},"keywords":["mass digitisation","crowd sourcing","citizen science","data quality control"],"license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"publication_date":"2018-05-21","relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1254702"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1254701"}}]},"resource_type":{"subtype":"article","title":"Journal article","type":"publication"},"title":"An Evaluation of In-house versus Out-sourced Data Capture at the Meise Botanic Garden (BR)"},"owners":[1161],"revision":4,"stats":{"downloads":16.0,"unique_downloads":16.0,"unique_views":7.0,"version_downloads":16.0,"version_unique_downloads":16.0,"version_unique_views":7.0,"version_views":7.0,"version_volume":1142896.0,"views":7.0,"volume":1142896.0},"updated":"2019-04-09T13:47:14.602643+00:00"},{"conceptdoi":"10.5281/zenodo.3257549","conceptrecid":"3257549","created":"2019-07-29T18:49:03.490785+00:00","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.3354489","files":[{"bucket":"f7496f7b-f6a4-470a-b819-f31693916188","checksum":"md5:c4f8070d8cc3230e4a873ece7ab3a3ce","key":"Report_Habitatge.pdf","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/f7496f7b-f6a4-470a-b819-f31693916188/Report_Habitatge.pdf"},"size":5265855,"type":"pdf"}],"id":3354489,"links":{"badge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.3354489.svg","bucket":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/f7496f7b-f6a4-470a-b819-f31693916188","conceptbadge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.3257549.svg","conceptdoi":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3257549","doi":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3354489","html":"https://zenodo.org/record/3354489","latest":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/3354489","latest_html":"https://zenodo.org/record/3354489","self":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/3354489"},"metadata":{"access_right":"open","access_right_category":"success","creators":[{"affiliation":"OpenSystems, Universitat de Barcelona","name":"Vicens, Juli\u00e1n","orcid":"0000-0003-0643-0469"},{"affiliation":"OpenSystems, Universitat de Barcelona","name":"Cigarini, Anna","orcid":"0000-0002-9328-8589"},{"affiliation":"OpenSystems, Universitat de Barcelona","name":"Perell\u00f3, Josep","orcid":"0000-0001-8533-6539"}],"description":"<p>Al llarg del proc&eacute;s de cocreaci&oacute; amb les comunitats de les biblioteques de Fort Pienc (Barcelona), Olesa de Montserrat i Granollers, les seves professionals s&rsquo;han erigit com a facilitadores d&rsquo;una recerca de ci&egrave;ncia ciutadana on els col&middot;lectius participants (40-45 usuaris/&agrave;ries de promig) i les seves viv&egrave;ncies i preocupacions han estat els principals motors de la recerca.&nbsp;Amb l&rsquo;objectiu com&uacute; de donar veu a una inquietud compartida pel conjunt de les comunitats motor sobre a l&rsquo;acc&eacute;s a l&rsquo;habitatge, s&rsquo;han dut a terme tres intervencions al carrer (una intervenci&oacute; durant tot un dia, una per cada municipi) que simulen el mercat del lloguer en forma de joc i que interpel&middot;len a ve&iuml;ns i ve&iuml;nes a posar-se en la situaci&oacute; de llogar un habitatge.

People from across the LIBER community translated the OSPP recommendations for libraries and combined them with suggestions drawn from their own expertise and experiences.</p>","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.1303002","keywords":["Open Science","Research Libraries","Metrics","FAIR Data","Scholarly Publishing","Research Infrastructures","Skills","Research Integrity","Citizen Science"],"language":"eng","license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"publication_date":"2018-07-02","related_identifiers":[{"identifier":"10.5281/zenodo.1303001","relation":"isVersionOf","scheme":"doi"}],"relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1303002"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1303001"}}]},"resource_type":{"subtype":"report","title":"Report","type":"publication"},"subjects":[],"title":"LIBER Open Science Roadmap"},"owners":[45182],"revision":4,"stats":{"downloads":2092.0,"unique_downloads":1740.0,"unique_views":3034.0,"version_downloads":2092.0,"version_unique_downloads":1740.0,"version_unique_views":3031.0,"version_views":3307.0,"version_volume":19513529572.0,"views":3310.0,"volume":19513529572.0},"updated":"2019-04-09T14:01:52.177730+00:00"},{"conceptdoi":"10.5281/zenodo.3346766","conceptrecid":"3346766","created":"2019-07-23T10:44:18.381133+00:00","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.3346767","files":[{"bucket":"93ddcf2a-45f5-45a8-a24b-280a9382473e","checksum":"md5:7278edd754794822cdbe03c5f3264de6","key":"Whitaker_HDRUKReproducibility_July2019.pdf","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/93ddcf2a-45f5-45a8-a24b-280a9382473e/Whitaker_HDRUKReproducibility_July2019.pdf"},"size":4775496,"type":"pdf"},{"bucket":"93ddcf2a-45f5-45a8-a24b-280a9382473e","checksum":"md5:19485708d744599947761401d0f0d181","key":"Whitaker_HDRUKReproducibility_July2019.pptx","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/93ddcf2a-45f5-45a8-a24b-280a9382473e/Whitaker_HDRUKReproducibility_July2019.pptx"},"size":42739765,"type":"pptx"}],"id":3346767,"links":{"badge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.3346767.svg","bucket":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/93ddcf2a-45f5-45a8-a24b-280a9382473e","conceptbadge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.3346766.svg","conceptdoi":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3346766","doi":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3346767","html":"https://zenodo.org/record/3346767","latest":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/3346767","latest_html":"https://zenodo.org/record/3346767","self":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/3346767"},"metadata":{"access_right":"open","access_right_category":"success","creators":[{"affiliation":"The Alan Turing Institute","name":"Whitaker, Kirstie","orcid":"0000-0001-8498-4059"}],"description":"<p>Kirstie&#39;s talk at the&nbsp;HDR UK Reproducible Machine Learning Workshop held at the Alan Turing Institute on 23 July 2019.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Bio</strong></p>\n\n<p>Kirstie Whitaker is a research fellow at the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.turing.ac.uk/\">Alan Turing Institute</a>&nbsp;(London, UK) and senior research associate in the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Cambridge.

I describe the creation of a species distribution EBV for the United Kingdom, covering 5293 species from 1970-2015. The data product contains an annual occupancy estimate for every species in each year, each with a measure of uncertainty. I will describe the workflow to produce this data product. The data collation step bring togehter different sources of occurrence records; the data standardisation step harmonizes these records to a common spatio-temporal resolution. These data are then converted into a set of 'detection histories' for each species within each taxonomic group, before being passed to the occupancy-detection model. Outputs from this model are then summarised as 1000 samples from the postierior distribution of occupancy estimates for each species:year combination. I will also describe the infrastructure requirements to create the EBV and to update it annually. This endeavour has been made possible because the vast majority of the 34 million species records have been collated and curated by 31 taxon-oriented citizen science groups. I go on to describe the challenges of harmonizing and integrating these occurrence records with other data types, such as from systematic surveys, including count data. Such \"integrated models\" are statisitcally challenging, but now within reach, thanks to the development of new tools that make it possible to conceive of modelling everything, everywhere. However, a substantial and concerted effort is required to curate biodiversity data in a way that maximises their potential for the next generation of models, and for truly global EBVs.</p>","doi":"10.3897/biss.3.37898","imprint":{"publisher":"Pensoft Publishers"},"journal":{"issue":"","pages":"e37898","title":"Biodiversity Information Science and Standards","volume":"3"},"keywords":["EBV","occupancy model"],"license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"publication_date":"2019-07-04","relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"3333087"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"3333086"}}]},"resource_type":{"subtype":"article","title":"Journal article","type":"publication"},"title":"Towards an annual species distribution EBV for the United Kingdom"},"owners":[1161],"revision":2,"stats":{"downloads":2.0,"unique_downloads":2.0,"unique_views":2.0,"version_downloads":2.0,"version_unique_downloads":2.0,"version_unique_views":2.0,"version_views":2.0,"version_volume":117414.0,"views":2.0,"volume":117414.0},"updated":"2019-07-12T07:05:48.534054+00:00"},{"conceptdoi":"10.5281/zenodo.1434701","conceptrecid":"1434701","created":"2018-12-12T10:37:31.381866+00:00","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.2222342","files":[{"bucket":"39c7aec6-46d0-4d59-9739-26c5eec4cb2e","checksum":"md5:80d8594ff931a9823cbc2efa1fe59026","key":"measurements_arduino.xlsx","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/39c7aec6-46d0-4d59-9739-26c5eec4cb2e/measurements_arduino.xlsx"},"size":53815509,"type":"xlsx"},{"bucket":"39c7aec6-46d0-4d59-9739-26c5eec4cb2e","checksum":"md5:6780d68e5dc0b2dbea4da0f8617c3a45","key":"measurements_bleair.xlsx","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/39c7aec6-46d0-4d59-9739-26c5eec4cb2e/measurements_bleair.xlsx"},"size":38021,"type":"xlsx"},{"bucket":"39c7aec6-46d0-4d59-9739-26c5eec4cb2e","checksum":"md5:edd8486380654bf235cf0f2d54a335bf","key":"measurements_sky_photos.xlsx","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/39c7aec6-46d0-4d59-9739-26c5eec4cb2e/measurements_sky_photos.xlsx"},"size":22777229,"type":"xlsx"}],"id":2222342,"links":{"badge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.2222342.svg","bucket":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/39c7aec6-46d0-4d59-9739-26c5eec4cb2e","conceptbadge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.1434701.svg","conceptdoi":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1434701","doi":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2222342","html":"https://zenodo.org/record/2222342","latest":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/2222342","latest_html":"https://zenodo.org/record/2222342","self":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/2222342"},"metadata":{"access_right":"open","access_right_category":"success","communities":[{"id":"h2020-hackair"}],"creators":[{"affiliation":"DRAXIS Environmental S.A.","name":"Panagiota Syropoulou","orcid":"0000-0003-2665-8831"},{"affiliation":"ITI-CERTH","name":"Anastasia Moumtzidou"},{"affiliation":"ITI-CERTH","name":"Symeon (Akis) Papadopoulos"},{"affiliation":"ITI-CERTH","name":"Eleftherios Spyromitros-Xioufis"},{"affiliation":"NILU","name":"Philipp Schneider"},{"affiliation":"NILU","name":"Hai-Ying Liu"},{"affiliation":"NILU","name":"Sonja Grossberndt"},{"affiliation":"BUND","name":"Arne Fellermann"},{"affiliation":"Technological Educational Institution of Athens","name":"Ilias Stavrakas"},{"affiliation":"Democritus University of Thrace","name":"Konstantinos Kourtidis"},{"affiliation":"imec","name":"Carina Veeckman"},{"affiliation":"OnSubject","name":"Wiebke Herding"}],"description":"<p>The current datasets comprise of air quality data collected or created within the hackAIR project (https://platform.hackair.eu/) all around Europe from February 2018 until November&nbsp;2018.</p>\n\n<p>i) &quot;measurements_arduino.xlsx&quot;: PM10 and PM2.5 measurements collected by hackAIR users with stationary hackAIR sensors (https://www.hackair.eu/hackair-home-v2/).

Hace apenas unas d&eacute;cadas era inimaginable la creciente influencia que la ciudadan&iacute;a iba a tener en la marcha de la ciencia. Y, aunque algunos movimientos de activistas contra las nucleares lograron en los 80 situar en la agenda pol&iacute;tica de muchos gobiernos la resistencia popular al desarrollo de esta fuente de energ&iacute;a, lo cierto es que la presencia hoy de las ONG en la toma de decisiones comienza a ser algo habitual y, en algunos casos, alcanza la condici&oacute;n de estructural. Las sociedades modernas han necesitado explorar formas muy innovadoras de organizaci&oacute;n social que les permitan afrontar las nuevas encrucijadas a las que nos aboca la llamada sociedad del riesgo. Nadie discute que estamos hablando de asuntos de extrema gravedad, como lo manifiesta la experiencia adquirida durante las anteriores crisis del SIDA, de los alimentos y cultivos transg&eacute;nicos y de las vacas locas. En su conjunto, los tres casos se&ntilde;alados (entre los muchos que podr&iacute;amos mencionar) comparten algunos aspectos que aqu&iacute; queremos subrayar. Quienes desde responsabilidades de gobierno o empresariales lamentaron el desbordamiento del tradicional sistema de expertos por los movimientos de agitaci&oacute;n ciudadana, aprendieron que la gesti&oacute;n de estos conflictos tiene que ser menos vertical y m&aacute;s dialogante. Descubrieron tambi&eacute;n que no es f&aacute;cil hacer frente a organizaciones que saben aprovechar muy bien las m&uacute;ltiples oportunidades que ofrecen las nuevas tecnolog&iacute;as de la informaci&oacute;n y de la comunicaci&oacute;n (TIC).</p>","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.2611087","keywords":["citizen science","participation in science","hackers","amateur"],"language":"spa","license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"notes":"Informe del Proyecto e-pcc (2004).

Wildlife-vehicle collisions (WVC) can occur frequently when wildlife are present, impacting drivers and animals. Because collisions are often avoidable with constructed mitigation and reduced speeds, transportation agencies often want to know where they can act most effectively and what kinds of mitigation are cost-effective. For this study, WVC occurrences were obtained from two sources: 1) highway agencies that monitor carcass retrieval and disposal by agency maintenance staff and 2) opportunistic observations of carcasses by participants in two statewide systems, the California Roadkill Observation System (CROS; http://wildlifecrossing.net/california) and the Maine Audubon Wildlife Road Watch (MAWRW; http://wildlifecrossing.net/maine). Between September, 2009 and December 31, 2014, &gt;33,700 independent observations of &gt;450 vertebrate species had been recorded in these online, form-based informatics systems by &gt;1,300 observers. We asked whether or not WVC observations collected by these extensive, volunteer-science networks could be used to inform transportation-mitigation planning. Cluster analyses of volunteer-observed WVC were performed using spatial autocorrelation tests for parts or all of 34 state highways and interstates. Statistically-significant WVC hotspots were modeled using the Getis-Ord Gi* statistic. High density locations of WVC, that were not necessarily hotspots, were also visualized. Statistically-significant hotspots were identified along ~7,900 km of highways. These hotspots are shown to vary in position from year to year. For highways with frequent deer-vehicle collisions, annual costs from collisions ranged from US$0 to &gt;US$30,000/km. Carcass clusters from volunteer data had very little or no overlap with similar findings from agency-collected WVC data, during a different time-range. We show that both state agency-collected and volunteer-collection of WVC observations could be useful in prioritizing mitigation action at US state-scales by state transportation agencies to protect biodiversity and driver safety. Because of the spatial extent and taxonomic accuracy at which volunteer observations can be collected, these may be the most important source of data for transportation agencies to protect drivers and

Probably originating from the Canary Islands and Madeira, the species is well established in Western Europe and large parts of the Mediterranean area and has spread recently into California and South America, while Central European populations were not known until 2011.</p>\n        <p>We report on long-time observations that reveal that at least two flourishing populations in Germany (Cologne) have been present for over five years, while in Ecuador one population has been observed between 2014 and 2018 and several other records were made in other parts of the country. Data obtained from the British Spider Recording Scheme demonstrate that the species moved significantly northwards since the report of the first populations in the very South of England, after several decades of relative stasis. The sudden northward expansion highly correlates with a massive rise in press coverage of the species.</p>\n        <p>In the Americas, S. nobilis is currently known from four countries (USA, Chile, Ecuador, Colombia), and available DNA barcoding data obtained for specimens from this area suggest that multiple introductions occurred within each country. Using ecological niche modeling, we identified suitable climate regions for the species and discuss possible reasons for its current spread. We propose that seaside cities and villages with a temperate oceanic or Mediterranean climate are especially favourable potential habitats for S. nobilis and will face the highest colonization pressure in the future, while tropical upland regions with temperate climates are also vulnerable to invasion by S. nobilis.</p>","doi":"10.3897/neobiota.42.31582","imprint":{"publisher":"Pensoft Publishers"},"journal":{"issue":"","pages":"19-43","title":"NeoBiota","volume":"42"},"keywords":["alien species","araneism","biological invasion","citizen science","spider","steatodism"],"license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"publication_date":"2019-02-11","relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"2572072"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"2572071"}}]},"resource_type":{"subtype":"article","title":"Journal article","type":"publication"},"title":"Steatoda nobilis, a false widow on the rise: a synthesis of past and current distribution trends"},"owners":[1161],"revision":2,"stats":{"downloads":3.0,"unique_downloads":3.0,"unique_views":4.0,"version_downloads":3.0,"version_unique_downloads":3.0,"version_unique_views":4.0,"version_views":4.0,"version_volume":7621497.0,"views":4.0,"volume":7621497.0},"updated":"2019-02-19T13:32:55.420916+00:00"},{"conceptdoi":"10.5281/zenodo.1284090","conceptrecid":"1284090","created":"2018-11-04T19:37:14.402801+00:00","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.1284091","files":[{"bucket":"509d062a-fbb5-4b27-b341-4cde1d19afb9","checksum":"md5:221633346ab03bc0d15194358e0bf6c1","key":"QuestionsAnswers.xlsx","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/509d062a-fbb5-4b27-b341-4cde1d19afb9/QuestionsAnswers.xlsx"},"size":27303,"type":"xlsx"},{"bucket":"509d062a-fbb5-4b27-b341-4cde1d19afb9","checksum":"md5:745b7b6b05bad0e1ba64c54e83f74b3c","key":"round.csv","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/509d062a-fbb5-4b27-b341-4cde1d19afb9/round.csv"},"size":37824,"type":"csv"},{"bucket":"509d062a-fbb5-4b27-b341-4cde1d19afb9","checksum":"md5:93391a5bf839d2201b9e57ed2de7e28c","key":"session.csv","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/509d062a-fbb5-4b27-b341-4cde1d19afb9/session.csv"},"size":4577,"type":"csv"},{"bucket":"509d062a-fbb5-4b27-b341-4cde1d19afb9","checksum":"md5:01acd6c5f8249f76afa802fab7badd8b","key":"user.csv","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/509d062a-fbb5-4b27-b341-4cde1d19afb9/user.csv"},"size":23166,"type":"csv"},{"bucket":"509d062a-fbb5-4b27-b341-4cde1d19afb9","checksum":"md5:88f8b57212f18fbbd9f082f2539abe57","key":"userround.csv","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/509d062a-fbb5-4b27-b341-4cde1d19afb9/userround.csv"},"size":142954,"type":"csv"}],"id":1284091,"links":{"badge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.1284091.svg","bucket":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/509d062a-fbb5-4b27-b341-4cde1d19afb9","conceptbadge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.1284090.svg","conceptdoi":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1284090","doi":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1284091","html":"https://zenodo.org/record/1284091","latest":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/1284091","latest_html":"https://zenodo.org/record/1284091","self":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/1284091"},"metadata":{"access_right":"open","access_right_category":"success","creators":[{"affiliation":"Universitat de Barcelona","name":"Vicens, Juli\u00e1n","orcid":"0000-0003-0643-0469"},{"affiliation":"Universidad Pontificia de Comillas","name":"Bueno-Guerra, Nereida","orcid":"0000-0003-1442-7905"},{"affiliation":"University of Warwick","name":"Gutierrez-Roig, Mario","orcid":"0000-0003-2045-1493"},{"affiliation":"University of Zaragoza","name":"Gracia-L\u00e1zaro, Carlos","orcid":"0000-0002-9769-8796"},{"affiliation":"University of Zaragoza","name":"G\u00f3mez-Garde\u00f1es, Jes\u00fas","orcid":"0000-0001-5204-1937"},{"affiliation":"Universitat de Barcelona","name":"Perell\u00f3, Josep","orcid":"0000-0001-8533-6539"},{"affiliation":"Universidad Carlos III de Madrid","name":"S\u00e1nchez, \u00c1ngel","orcid":"0000-0003-1874-2881"},{"affiliation":"University of Zaragoza","name":"Moreno, Yamir","orcid":"0000-0002-0895-1893"},{"affiliation":"Universitat Rovira i Virgili","name":"Duch, Jordi","orcid":"0000-0003-2639-6333"}],"description":"<p>Climate change mitigation is a shared global challenge that involves the collective action of a set of individuals with different tendencies to cooperation.

Hudson, born 1867 in London, developed a strong interest in nature when he was nine years old and began collecting insects. At the age of 13 he wrote and illustrated his first manuscript on insects.</p>\n  <p>In 1881 Hudson moved to New Zealand, where he worked as a clerk in the post office in Wellington until his retirement in 1919. However, he kept collecting, investigating and describing insects in his spare time, and was determined to present New Zealand's insect fauna to the general public. He was critical of the formal education system and provided alternative methods of learning through his books. His achievements place him among New Zealand's distinguished pioneer naturalists.</p>\n  <p>After Hudson's death in April 1946, his collection of insects, one of the largest and most valuable private collection in New Zealand, was donated to the Dominion Museum with the condition that it remained intact in its nine original cabinets. These are made from kauri and are full of neatly pinned in sects, Hudson invented his own coding system for labelling his specimens. The numbers that refer to each specimen were recorded in three volumes of register books, where he noted details about the samples. These registers are the only way we can understand the collection. However, since Hudson had a very idiosyncratic handwriting and wrote between lines when he ran out of space, his registers are very hard to read. Also, he changed names, deleted numbers of specimens that were given away and reused those numbers. In short, these registers were living documents that changed with the collection.</p>\n  <p>This collection is of immense scientific value and it has been well protected in climate-controlled conditions, although quite inaccessible for many years. Now, the kauri cabinets are secured to shelving units bolted to the floor and a wall. This provides protection against flooding and earthquake hazards. The registers and the specimens in the drawers are part of a digitisation program. All the information on the aging register pages were scanned in high resolution.

Unfortunately, most of the taxonomic information is available in scientific publications in text format. The amount of publications generated is very large; therefore, to process it in order to obtain high structured texts would be complex and very expensive. Approaches like citizen science may help the process by selecting whole fragments of texts dealing with morphological descriptions; but a deeper analysis, compatible with accepted ontologies, will require specialised tools. The Biodiversity Heritage Library (BHL) estimates that there are more than 120 million pages published in over 5.4 million books since 1469, plus about 800,000 monographs and 40,000 journal titles (12,500 of these are current titles).</p>\n  <p>It is necessary to develop standards and software tools to extract, integrate and publish this information into existing free and open access repositories of biodiversity knowledge to support science, education and biodiversity conservation.</p>\n  <p>This document presents an algorithm based on computational linguistics techniques to extract structured information from morphological descriptions of plants written in Spanish. The developed algorithm is based on the work of Dr. Hong Cui from the University of Arizona; it uses semantic analysis, ontologies and a repository of knowledge acquired from the same descriptions. The algorithm was applied to the books Trees of Costa Rica Volume III (TCRv3), Trees of Costa Rica Volume IV (TCRv4) and to a subset of descriptions of the Manual of Plants of Costa Rica (MPCR) with very competitive results (more than 92.5% of average performance). The system receives the morphological descriptions in tabular format and generates XML documents. The XML schema allows documenting structures, characters and relations between characters and structures. Each extracted object is associated with attributes like name, value, modifiers, restrictions, ontology term id, amongst other attributes.</p>\n  <p>The implemented tool is free software.

As this forestry crop grows in popularity around the world, the exotic introduction of pests such as the leaf beetles belonging to the genera Paropsis Oliver, 1807 and Paropsisterna Motschulsky, 1860 increases in frequency. These pest introductions have spurred a need to understand the natural enemies of these pests for use in classical biological control programs. One such enemy, Eadya paropsidis Huddleston &amp; Short, 1978 (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), has shown potential as a biological control agent against Paropsis charybdis, an exotic pest of New Zealand Eucalyptus plantations. However, observations made by biocontrol researchers have raised concerns that E. paropsidis is a complex of cryptic species. A comprehensive large-scale phylogenetic study utilizing both host and molecular data (Peixoto et al. 2018), as well as a morphological multivariate ratio analysis, was utilized to ensure accurate delimitation of the species of Eadya. Here we formally describe the three new species (Eadya annleckieae Ridenbaugh, 2018, sp. n., Eadya daenerys Ridenbaugh, 2018, sp. n., Eadya spitzer Ridenbaugh, 2018, sp. n.), and one additional new species discovered in the Australian National Insect Collection (Eadya duncan Ridenbaugh, 2018, sp. n.). All distributions and host associations for Eadya are listed as well as a redescription of the originally described E. paropsidis and E. falcata. An illustrated key to all known species is included to assist biological control researchers. The value of citizen science observations is discussed, along with the need for a further understanding of mainland Eadya populations given the recent spread of paropsine pests. Finally, we discuss the subfamilial placement of Eadya, and suggest it belongs within Euphorinae based on morphological characters.</p>","doi":"10.3897/jhr.64.24282","imprint":{"publisher":"Pensoft Publishers"},"journal":{"issue":"","pages":"141-175","title":"Journal of Hymenoptera Research","volume":"64"},"keywords":["Animalia","Arthropoda","Insecta","Hymenoptera","Ichneumonoidea","Braconidae","Eadya","Plantae","Tracheophyta","Magnoliopsida","Myrtales","Myrtaceae","Eucalyptus","Parasitoid wasps","Taxonomy","DNA Barcoding","Morphometrics","Biological Control","Tasmania","New South Wales","Victoria","Euphorinae","Eucalyptus"],"license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"publication_date":"2018-06-25","relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1303458"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1303457"}}]},"resource_type":{"subtype":"article","title":"Journal article","type":"publication"},"title":"Description of four new species of Eadya (Hymenoptera, Braconidae), parasitoids of the Eucalyptus Tortoise Beetle (Paropsis charybdis) and other Eucalyptus defoliating leaf beetles"},"owners":[1161],"revision":3,"stats":{"downloads":15.0,"unique_downloads":15.0,"unique_views":6.0,"version_downloads":15.0,"version_unique_downloads":15.0,"version_unique_views":6.0,"version_views":6.0,"version_volume":238432275.0,"views":6.0,"volume":238432275.0},"updated":"2019-04-09T14:01:58.352810+00:00"},{"conceptrecid":"605741","created":"2016-02-15T10:13:54+00:00","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.11864","files":[{"bucket":"1edd61b2-3533-4738-a686-9a5a839b5489","checksum":"md5:65cef3b6b4c2404787d3e664c7d579b0","key":"Vision_Statement_on_Transatlantic_Ocean_Literacy_2014.pdf","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/1edd61b2-3533-4738-a686-9a5a839b5489/Vision_Statement_on_Transatlantic_Ocean_Literacy_2014.pdf"},"size":620417,"type":"pdf"}],"id":11864,"links":{"badge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.11864.svg","bucket":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/1edd61b2-3533-4738-a686-9a5a839b5489","doi":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11864","html":"https://zenodo.org/record/11864","latest":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/11864","latest_html":"https://zenodo.org/record/11864","self":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/11864"},"metadata":{"access_right":"open","access_right_category":"success","communities":[{"id":"euro-basin"},{"id":"ivo_grigorov"},{"id":"oceanliteracy"},{"id":"ecfunded"},{"id":"zenodo"}],"creators":[{"affiliation":"NMEA & College of Exploration, USA","name":"Tuddenham, Peter"},{"affiliation":"EURO-BASIN Project Office, Denmark","name":"Grigorov, Ivo"},{"affiliation":"College of Exploration, USA","name":"Bishop, Tina"},{"affiliation":"Nautilus Educational, Australia","name":"Breidahl, Harry "},{"affiliation":"NAUSICAA, France","name":"Cira, Manuel"},{"affiliation":"European Marine Sciecen Educators Association (EMSEA)","name":"Copejans, Evy"},{"affiliation":"European Marine Sciecen Educators Association (EMSEA)","name":"Crouch, Fiona"},{"affiliation":"Un.

Interlocking efforts bring together international partnerships and networks, national, regional and institutional projects and investments and countless individual contributors, spanning diverse biological and environmental research domains, government agencies and non-governmental organisations, citizen science and commercial enterprise. However, current efforts remain inefficient and inadequate to address the global need for accurate data on the world's species and on changing patterns and trends in biodiversity. Significant challenges include imbalances in regional engagement in biodiversity informatics activity, uneven progress in data mobilisation and sharing, the lack of stable persistent identifiers for data records, redundant and incompatible processes for cleaning and interpreting data and the absence of functional mechanisms for knowledgeable experts to curate and improve data.</p>\n  <p>The first Global Biodiversity Informatics Conference (GBIC) in 2012 delivered the Global Biodiversity Informatics Outlook (GBIO,\u00a0Hobern et al. 2012), an architectural vision for the major components of a distributed global infrastructure for biodiiversity information, but realigning the work\u00a0of existing organisations and projects to achieve this vision remains challenging.\u00a0Recognising the need for greater alignment between efforts at all scales, the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) convened the second Global Biodiversity Informatics Conference (GBIC2) in July 2018 to propose a coordination mechanism for developing shared roadmaps for biodiversity informatics. GBIC2 attendees reached consensus on the need for a global <em>alliance for biodiversity knowledge</em>, learning from examples such as the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) and the open software communities under the Apache Software Foundation. These initiatives provide models for multiple stakeholders with decentralised funding and independent governance to combine resources and develop sustainable solutions that address common needs.</p>\n  <p>GBIF was asked to coordinate next steps following GBIC2, including publication of a paper, Connecting data and expertise: a new alliance for biodiversity knowledge (Hobern et al. 2019).

I will highlight the challenges GBIF faces identifying potential data quality problems and what we and others (Zizka et al. 2019) are doing to discover and address them.</p>\n  <p>GBIF is the largest open-data portal of biodiversity data, which is a large network of individual datasets (&gt; 40k) from various sources and publishers. Since these datasets are variable both within themselves and dataset-to-dataset, this creates a challenge for users wanting to use data collected from museums, smartphones, atlases, satellite tracking, DNA sequencing, and various other sources for research or analysis.</p>\n  <p>Data quality at GBIF will always be a moving target (Chapman 2005), and GBIF already handles many obvious errors such as zero/impossible coordinates, empty or invalid\u00a0data fields, and fuzzy taxon matching. Since GBIF primarily (but not exclusively) serves lat-lon location information, there is an expectation that occurrences fall somewhat close to where the species actually occurs. This is not always the case. Occurrence data can be hundereds\u00a0of kilometers\u00a0away\u00a0from where the species naturally occur, and there can be multiple reasons for why this can happen, which might not be entirely obvious to users.</p>\n  <p>One reasons is that many GBIF datasets are gridded. Gridded datasets are datasets that have low resolution due to equally-spaced sampling. This can be a data quality issue because a user might assume an occurrence record was recorded exactly at its coordinates. Country centroids\u00a0are another reason why a species occurrence record might be far from where it occurs naturally.\u00a0GBIF does not yet flag country centroids, which are records where the dataset publishers has entered the lat-long center of a country instead of leaving the field blank.\u00a0I will discuss the challenges surrounding locating these issues and the current solutions (such as the CoordinateCleaner R package).</p>\n  <p>I will touch on how existing DWCA terms like coordinateUncertaintyInMeters and footprintWKT\u00a0are being utilized to highlight low coordinate resolution. Finally, I will highlight some other emerging data quality issues and how GBIF is beginning to experiment with dataset-level flagging. Currently we have flagged around 500 datasets as gridded and around 400 datasets as citizen science, but there are many more potential dataset flags.</p>","doi":"10.3897/biss.3.35829","imprint":{"publisher":"Pensoft Publishers"},"journal":{"issue":"","pages":"e35829","title":"Biodiversity Information Science and Standards","volume":"3"},"keywords":["GBIF","Data Quality","Gridded Datasets","Country Centroids","CoordinateCleaner","coordinateUncertaintyInMeters","footprintWKT"],"license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"publication_date":"2019-06-13","relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"3251247"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"3251246"}}]},"resource_type":{"subtype":"article","title":"Journal article","type":"publication"},"title":"Data Location Quality at GBIF"},"owners":[1161],"revision":2,"stats":{"downloads":4.0,"unique_downloads":4.0,"unique_views":4.0,"version_downloads":4.0,"version_unique_downloads":4.0,"version_unique_views":4.0,"version_views":4.0,"version_volume":474808.0,"views":4.0,"volume":474808.0},"updated":"2019-06-21T07:05:45.777527+00:00"},{"conceptrecid":"784040","created":"2017-05-12T17:01:41.710772+00:00","doi":"10.3897/zookeys.480.8803","files":[{"bucket":"d2ea58ab-8542-489f-98c4-a78efa17cf04","checksum":"md5:0dd21df000b5cd08b0a75de6853816f6","key":"ZK_article_4633.pdf","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/d2ea58ab-8542-489f-98c4-a78efa17cf04/ZK_article_4633.pdf"},"size":3647564,"type":"pdf"},{"bucket":"d2ea58ab-8542-489f-98c4-a78efa17cf04","checksum":"md5:11830219e6688ac215d9c423c88b4155","key":"ZK_article_4633.xml","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/d2ea58ab-8542-489f-98c4-a78efa17cf04/ZK_article_4633.xml"},"size":100238,"type":"xml"}],"id":578728,"links":{"badge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.3897/zookeys.480.8803.svg","bucket":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/d2ea58ab-8542-489f-98c4-a78efa17cf04","doi":"https://doi.org/10.3897/zookeys.480.8803","html":"https://zenodo.org/record/578728","latest":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/578728","latest_html":"https://zenodo.org/record/578728","self":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/578728"},"metadata":{"access_right":"open","access_right_category":"success","communities":[{"id":"biosyslit"}],"creators":[{"affiliation":"The University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom","name":"Silvertown, Jonathan"},{"affiliation":"The Open University, Milton Keynes, United Kingdom","name":"Harvey, Martin"},{"affiliation":"The Open University, Milton Keynes, United Kingdom","name":"Greenwood, Richard"},{"affiliation":"The Open University, Milton Keynes, United Kingdom","name":"Dodd, Mike"},{"affiliation":"The Open University, Milton Keynes, United Kingdom","name":"Rosewell, Jon"},{"affiliation":"SANBI, Cape Town, United Kingdom","name":"Rebelo, Tony"},{"affiliation":"The Open University, Milton Keynes, United Kingdom","name":"Ansine, Janice"},{"affiliation":"The Open University, Milton Keynes, United Kingdom","name":"McConway, Kevin"}],"description":"<p>Accurate species identification is fundamental to biodiversity science, but the natural history skills required for this are neglected in formal education at all levels. In this paper we describe how the web application ispotnature.org and its sister site ispot.org.za (collectively, \"iSpot\") are helping to solve this problem by combining learning technology with crowdsourcing to connect beginners with experts. Over 94% of observations submitted to iSpot receive a determination. External checking of a sample of 3,287 iSpot records verified &gt; 92% of them. To mid 2014, iSpot crowdsourced the identification of 30,000 taxa (&gt;80% at species level) in &gt; 390,000 observations with a global community numbering &gt; 42,000 registered participants. More than half the observations on ispotnature.org were named within an hour of submission. iSpot uses a unique, 9-dimensional reputation system to motivate and reward participants and to verify determinations. Taxon-specific reputation points are earned when a participant proposes an identification that achieves agreement from other participants, weighted by the agreers' own reputation scores for the taxon. This system is able to discriminate effectively between competing determinations when two or more are proposed for the same observation. In 57% of such cases the reputation system improved the accuracy of the determination, while in the remainder it either improved precision (e.g. by adding a species name to a genus) or revealed false precision, for example where a determination to species level was not supported by the available evidence. We propose that the success of iSpot arises from the structure of its social network that efficiently connects beginners and experts, overcoming the social as well as geographic barriers that normally separate the two.</p>","doi":"10.3897/zookeys.480.8803","journal":{"issue":"","pages":"125-146","title":"ZooKeys","volume":"480"},"keywords":["Biodiversity","Citizen Science","Crowdsourcing","Identification","Learning","Learning design","social networking"],"license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"publication_date":"2015-02-02","relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"578728"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"784040"}}]},"resource_type":{"subtype":"article","title":"Journal article","type":"publication"},"title":"Crowdsourcing the identification of organisms: A case-study of iSpot"},"owners":[1161],"revision":5,"stats":{"downloads":3.0,"unique_downloads":3.0,"unique_views":5.0,"version_downloads":3.0,"version_unique_downloads":3.0,"version_unique_views":5.0,"version_views":5.0,"version_volume":10942692.0,"views":5.0,"volume":10942692.0},"updated":"2019-02-18T21:26:05.494943+00:00"},{"conceptrecid":"642754","created":"2014-03-10T17:39:50+00:00","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.8306","files":[{"bucket":"02372303-ea55-4468-86d6-d8360a7ece40","checksum":"md5:bb09cbaa852e54c77db3d0201f379c28","key":"ODE-WP3-DEL-0002-1_0_public_final.pdf","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/02372303-ea55-4468-86d6-d8360a7ece40/ODE-WP3-DEL-0002-1_0_public_final.pdf"},"size":552472,"type":"pdf"}],"id":8306,"links":{"badge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.8306.svg","bucket":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/02372303-ea55-4468-86d6-d8360a7ece40","doi":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8306","html":"https://zenodo.org/record/8306","latest":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/8306","latest_html":"https://zenodo.org/record/8306","self":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/8306"},"metadata":{"access_right":"open","access_right_category":"success","communities":[{"id":"ode-project"},{"id":"ecfunded"},{"id":"zenodo"}],"creators":[{"affiliation":"Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research","name":"Sch\u00e4fer, Angela"},{"affiliation":"Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research","name":"Pampel, Heinz"},{"affiliation":"Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research","name":"Pfeiffenberger, Hans"},{"affiliation":"CERN","name":"Dallmeier-Tiessen, Sunje"},{"affiliation":"CSC - IT Center for Science Ltd.","name":"Tissari, Satu"},{"affiliation":"STFC Rutherford Appleton Laboratory","name":"Darby, Robert"},{"affiliation":"Alliance for Permanent Access","name":"Giaretta, Krystina"},{"affiliation":"Alliance for Permanent Access","name":"Giaretta, David"},{"affiliation":"Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research","name":"Gitmans, Kathrin"},{"affiliation":"CSC - IT Center for Science Ltd.","name":"Helin, Heikki"},{"affiliation":"STFC Rutherford Appleton Laboratory","name":"Lambert, Simon "},{"affiliation":"CERN","name":"Mele, Salvatore"},{"affiliation":"LIBER \u2013 Association of European Research Libraries","name":"Reilly, Susan"},{"affiliation":"CERN","name":"Ruiz, Sergio"},{"affiliation":"CSC - IT Center for Science Ltd.","name":"Sandberg, Marie"},{"affiliation":"LIBER \u2013 Association of European Research Libraries","name":"Schallier, Wouter"},{"affiliation":"Deutsche Nationalbibliothek,","name":"Schrimpf, Sabine "},{"affiliation":"The International Association of STM Publishers","name":"Smit, Eefke"},{"affiliation":"The British Library,","name":"Wilkinson, Max"},{"affiliation":"STFC Rutherford Appleton Laboratory","name":"Wilson, Michael"}],"description":"<p>To gain a broad and common understanding the ODE project collected 21 stories, in which significant stakeholders describe their experiences and their view on the topic.

The labels of these specimens contain valuable information for research, but their transcription can be difficult and time-consuming, with often hard to read handwritten labels. Whilst accurate label transcription is only one step along the way to create a specimen record fit for different research uses, it is an extremely important one. It would be very time-consuming to have to return to recheck label information for even a very small proportion of specimens.\u00a0Once a specimen\u00a0label\u00a0is transcribed correctly, it becomes much easier to enhance the record with additional information from other sources, e.g. from literature or collector itineraries. It also becomes feasible to determine the point of collection from the textual information on the label by a process known as georeferencing, or even to find inaccuracies within the label itself.</p>\n  <p>Under\u00a0the auspices of\u00a0the project Innovation and Consolidation for Large Scale Digitisation of Natural Heritage (ICEDIG), we\u00a0compared different manual approaches to transcription of\u00a0collection labels. Using herbarium specimens as an example, the quality of transcribed data by:</p>\n  \n    in-house trained institute staff,\n    outsourcing to a commercial company or\n    transcription by the general public through online crowdsourcing platforms was compared through two transcription pilots.\n  \n  <p>The first pilot consisted of 200 S<em>olanum</em> specimen images from the Royal Botanic Gardens Kew in the UK and 200 from Meise Botanic Garden in Belgium. This particular genus was chosen as both institutes had specimens from which the label data had already been transcribed through the digitisation company Picturae, completed by Alembo. The Kew specimens had also been transcribed in-house by staff employed as digitisation officers or curators\u00a0and by an independant researcher. The images from both institutes were uploaded to two crowdsourcing platforms: DigiVol and DoeDat. In a second pilot, multiple European institutions holding botanical collections were approached to provide a sample of 200 digitally imaged herbarium sheet specimens to upload to multiple crowdsourcing platforms. Specimens from 7 institutions were uploaded for transcription to 5 different crowdsourcing platforms: DigiVol, DoeDat, Die Herbonauten, Les Herbonautes and Notes from Nature.</p>\n  <p>For both pilots, key transcription data were assessed and common errors in label transcription identified. Reasons for these errors will be discussed along with possible mechanisms to improve the accuracy of the transcriptions.\u00a0The need for standards for transcription is identified and recommendations made.</p>","doi":"10.3897/biss.3.37306","imprint":{"publisher":"Pensoft Publishers"},"journal":{"issue":"","pages":"e37306","title":"Biodiversity Information Science and Standards","volume":"3"},"keywords":["data capture","data quality","Citizen Science"],"license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"publication_date":"2019-06-21","relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"3261928"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"3261927"}}]},"resource_type":{"subtype":"article","title":"Journal article","type":"publication"},"title":"Evaluating Methods for Transcribing Specimen Labels"},"owners":[1161],"revision":2,"stats":{"downloads":3.0,"unique_downloads":3.0,"unique_views":3.0,"version_downloads":3.0,"version_unique_downloads":3.0,"version_unique_views":3.0,"version_views":3.0,"version_volume":212571.0,"views":3.0,"volume":212571.0},"updated":"2019-06-29T07:05:45.940114+00:00"},{"conceptrecid":"787980","created":"2017-05-24T09:13:39.643561+00:00","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.582804","files":[{"bucket":"405d0c51-ddd6-4c66-8130-08c846c503d6","checksum":"md5:a6e2a3c00b9ec8675465ac1ab9f17a03","key":"SZdeclaration.pdf","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/405d0c51-ddd6-4c66-8130-08c846c503d6/SZdeclaration.pdf"},"size":1283581,"type":"pdf"}],"id":582804,"links":{"badge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.582804.svg","bucket":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/405d0c51-ddd6-4c66-8130-08c846c503d6","doi":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.582804","html":"https://zenodo.org/record/582804","latest":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/582804","latest_html":"https://zenodo.org/record/582804","self":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/582804"},"metadata":{"access_right":"open","access_right_category":"success","creators":[{"affiliation":"Oak Spring Garden Founda\u019fon, 1776 Loughborough Lane, Upperville,  VA 20184, USA and Yale School of Forestry & Environmental Studies, New  Haven, CT 06511, USA.","name":"Crane, Peter R."},{"affiliation":"The State Key Laboratory of Systema\u019fc and Evolu\u019fonary Botany, Ins\u019ftute  of Botany, CAS, Beijing 100093, China.","name":"Ge, Song"},{"affiliation":"The State Key Laboratory of Systema\u019fc and Evolu\u019fonary Botany, Ins\u019ftute  of Botany, CAS, Beijing 100093, China.","name":"Hong , De-Yuan"},{"affiliation":"South China Botanical Garden, CAS, Guangzhou, 510650, China.","name":"Huang , Hong-Wen"},{"affiliation":"Fairy Lake Botanical Garden, Shenzhen & CAS, Shenzhen, Guangdong  518004, China.","name":"Jiao, Gen-Lin"},{"affiliation":"Department of Life Sciences, Natural History Museum, London SW7 5BD, UK.","name":"Knapp, Sandra"},{"affiliation":"Department of Botany, Na\u019fonal Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian  Ins\u019ftu\u019fon, Washington, DC 20013-7012, USA","name":"Kress, W.

In order to address a gap in research literature, this paper deals with a survey conducted to assess the current state of geo-crowdsourcing, a recent phenomenon popular with people who collect geographic information using their smartphones. This article points out that there is an increasing body of knowledge of geo-crowdsourcing mobile applications in the Visegrad countries marked by the ubiquitous Internet connection and the current massive proliferation of smartphones. This article shows how geo-crowdsourcing can be used as a complement, or in some cases a replacement, to traditionally generated sources of spatial data and information in public management.

La subcuenca del r&iacute;o Cot&oacute;n cuenta con amenazas y oportunidades de conservaci&oacute;n, las cuales deben ser abordadas a trav&eacute;s de su ordenamiento territorial, entendido esto como un espacio de construcci&oacute;n social en torno a la sostenibilidad ambiental. Para el ordenamiento de este territorio, debemos conocer la riqueza biol&oacute;gica y ecosist&eacute;mica, como l&iacute;nea base para establecer y ejecutar un plan de manejo y ordenamiento de la subcuenca del r&iacute;o Cot&oacute;n. Aqu&iacute; presentamos la primera fase de la caracterizaci&oacute;n biol&oacute;gica de la subcuenca del r&iacute;o Cot&oacute;n, en la que se realiz&oacute; un trabajo de campo para obtener un inventario preliminar de anfibios, reptiles, peces, aves y mam&iacute;feros. Este inventario fue complementado con la revisi&oacute;n y organizaci&oacute;n de fuentes de informaci&oacute;n secundaria, as&iacute; como un an&aacute;lisis con Sistemas de Informaci&oacute;n Geogr&aacute;fica (SIG). Para la subcuenca del r&iacute;o Cot&oacute;n, encontramos 53 especies de anfibios, de las cuales 15 se encuentran en alguna categor&iacute;a de amenaza (Vulnerable, En Peligro y Peligro Cr&iacute;tico seg&uacute;n la IUCN) y por lo tanto tienen importancia para la conservaci&oacute;n. Para reptiles registramos 30 especies, de las cuales <em>Geophis talamancae</em> es la &uacute;nica amenazada (En Peligro), pero otras 5 especies tienen distribuci&oacute;n restringida a Costa Rica y Panam&aacute;. Para Aves se recopilaron 205 especies, de las cuales 5 son de importancia para conservaci&oacute;n por encontrarse en categor&iacute;a de Vulnerable. En cuanto a mam&iacute;feros se han registrado 41 especies, de las cuales 6 se encuentran en alguna categor&iacute;a de amenaza. Para peces pocas especies se ha evaluado su riesgo de extinci&oacute;n, pero algunas de ellas est&aacute;n restringidas a la zona pac&iacute;fico sur de Costa Rica o a Panam&aacute; y Costa Rica, por lo tanto son importantes para conservar. La riqueza biol&oacute;gica representativa de esta subcuenca cuenta con especies amenazadas, end&eacute;micas e irremplazables, que hacen de la subcuenca del r&iacute;o Cot&oacute;n, un importante &aacute;rea para la conservaci&oacute;n de la biodiversidad en Costa Rica. Amenazas como la p&eacute;rdida y degradaci&oacute;n de h&aacute;bitat, la cacer&iacute;a, contaminaci&oacute;n y potenciales proyectos hidroel&eacute;ctricos, pueden poner en peligro la supervivencia de las poblaciones de las especies que habitan la subcuenca y que son de inter&eacute;s para conservaci&oacute;n. Teniendo en cuenta que la econom&iacute;a de esta zona est&aacute; basada en la agricultura y es una zona de alto potencial tur&iacute;stico, debe darse prioridad al desarrollo en estos sectores de manera sostenible, de manera que se mitigue o elimine la deforestaci&oacute;n, contaminaci&oacute;n y cacer&iacute;a, y se eviten proyectos de infraestructura energ&eacute;tica que modifiquen las condiciones ecol&oacute;gicas de la subcuenca.</p>","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.2566686","keywords":["biodiversity","citizen science","mammals","reptiles","amphibians","fish","birds","threaten species"],"language":"spa","license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"publication_date":"2018-03-01","references":["Arrieta, O. 2010.

The largest single contributor of species observations is eBird, which so far has contributed more than 361 million records to GBIF. eBird engages a vast network of human observers (citizen-scientists) to report bird observations, with the goal of estimating the range, abundance, habitat preferences, and trends of bird species at high spatial and temporal resolutions across each species' entire life-cycle.\u00a0 Since its inception, eBird has focused on improving the data quality of its observations, primarily focused in two areas:</p>\n  \n    ensuring that participants describe how they gathered their observations and,\n    all observations are reviewed for accuracy.\n  \n  <p>In this presentation I will review how this is done in eBird.</p>\n  <p>Standardized Data Collection. eBird gathers bird observations based on how bird watchers typically observe birds with units of data collection being \"checklists\" of zero or more species including a count of individuals for each species observed.\u00a0 Participants choose the location where they made their observations and submit their checklists via Mobile Apps (50% of all submissions) or the website (50% of all submissions). All checklists are submitted in a standard format identifying where, how, and with whom they made their observations. Mobile apps precisely record locations, the track taken, and the distance they traveled while making the observations. The start time and duration of surveys are also recorded. All observers must report whether they reported all the birds they detected and identified, which allows analysts to infer absence of birds if they were not reported. All data are stored within an Oracle data management framework.</p>\n  <p>Data Accuracy. The most significant data quality challenge for species observations is detecting and correctly identifying organisms to species. The issue involves how to handle both false positives \u2014 the misidentification of an observed organism, and false negatives\u2014failing to report a species that was present. The most egregious false positives can be identified as anomalies that fall outside the norm of occurrence for a species at a particular time or space. However, false positives can also be misidentifications of common species.\u00a0 These challenges are addressed by:</p>\n  <ul>\n    Data-driven filters. \u00a0eBird's existing data can identify and flag potentially erroneous records at increasingly fine spatial, temporal, and user-specific scales. These filters can identify outliers and likely errors, which are the foundation of the eBird review process. By using the vetted data to identify outliers, data quality checks run against expected occurrence probabilities at very fine scales and identify anomalies during data submission (including on mobile devices).\n    Incorporate observer expertise scores. Observer differences are the largest source of variability in eBird data. Assessment of observer metrics, and the inclusion of these data in species distribution models, improves analysis output and model performance.\n    Expert reviewer network. More than 2000 volunteers review records identified by the data-driven filters and contact data submitters to confirm their observations. The existing data quality process functions globally. Currently the approach is focused on misidentified birds, but in the future will also involve collection event issues (e.g., issues with protocol, location, or methodology), sensitive species, exotic species, and better handle widely-observed individual rarities.

The rise of large data aggregators such as GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facility), iDigBio (Integrated Digitized Biocollections), the ALA (Atlas of Living Australia) and its many clones, OBIS (Ocean Biogeographic Information System), SIBBr (Sistema de Informa\u00e7\u00e3o sobre a Biodiversidade Brasileria), CRIA (Centro de Refer\u00eancia em Informa\u00e7\u00e3o Ambiental) and many others has made access to large volumes of data easier, but choosing which data are fit for use remains a more difficult task. There has been no consistency between the various aggregators on how best to clean and document the quality \u2013 how tests are run, or how annotations are stored and reported. Feedback to data custodians on possible errors has been minimal, inconsistent, and adherence to recommendations and controlled vocabularies (where they exist) has been haphazard to say the least.</p>\n  <p>The TDWG Data Quality Interest Group is addressing these issues, either alone or in conjunction with other Interest Groups (Annotations, Darwin Core, Invasive Species, Citizen Science and Vocabulary Maintenance) to develop a framework, tests and assertions, use cases and controlled vocabularies. The Interest Group is also working closely with the data aggregators toward consistent implementations. The practical work is being done through five Task Groups. A published framework is leading to a user-friendly Fitness for Use Backbone (FFUB) and data quality profiles by which users can document the quality they need for a project. A standard set of core tests and assertions has been developed around the Darwin Core standard and are currently being tested and integrated into several aggregators. A use case library has been compiled and these cases will lead to themed data quality profiles as part of the FFUB. Two new Task Groups are being established to develop controlled vocabularies to address the inconsistencies in values of at least 40 Darwin Core terms. These inconsistencies make the evaluation of fitness for use far more difficult than achieved by using controlled vocabularies. The first TG is looking at vocabularies generally, while the second is looking at those just pertaining to Invasive Species.</p>\n  <p>It is not just the aggregators though that are the stakeholders in this work. The data custodians and even the collectors have a vested interest in ensuring their data and metadata are of highest quality and therefore seeing their data used widely.\u00a0It is only after aggregation that many uses of the data become apparent, and most collectors aren't aware of these uses at the time of collecting. Issues of data quality at the time of collection can later restrict the range of later uses of the data. \u00a0Feeding back information to the data custodians from users and aggregators on suspect records is essential, and this is where annotations and reporting back on the results of tests conducted by aggregators is important. The project is also generating standard code and test data for the tests and assertions so that data custodians can readily integrate them into their own procedures. It is far cheaper to correct errors at the source than try and rectify them further down the line.</p>\n  <p>A lot of progress has been made, but we still have a long way to go \u2013 join us in making biodiversity data quality a product of which we can all be proud.</p>","doi":"10.3897/tdwgproceedings.1.20240","imprint":{"publisher":"Pensoft Publishers"},"journal":{"issue":"","pages":"e20240","title":"Biodiversity Information Science and Standards","volume":"1"},"keywords":["TDWG BDQIG \"Data Quality\" \"Fitness for Use\" Framework \"Tests and Assertions\" quality vocabularies"],"license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"publication_date":"2017-08-14","relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1140500"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1140499"}}]},"resource_type":{"subtype":"article","title":"Journal article","type":"publication"},"title":"Fitness for Use: The BDQIG aims for improved Stability and Consistency"},"owners":[1161],"revision":4,"stats":{"downloads":13.0,"unique_downloads":13.0,"unique_views":5.0,"version_downloads":13.0,"version_unique_downloads":13.0,"version_unique_views":5.0,"version_views":5.0,"version_volume":615186.0,"views":5.0,"volume":615186.0},"updated":"2019-04-09T13:26:51.823430+00:00"},{"conceptdoi":"10.5281/zenodo.1308971","conceptrecid":"1308971","created":"2018-10-22T15:04:17.155981+00:00","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.1308972","files":[{"bucket":"ec3ed28f-dbb3-4109-ba38-62a311b4db24","checksum":"md5:e40917b0cb299c06c340913423fd92bf","key":"dictator.csv","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/ec3ed28f-dbb3-4109-ba38-62a311b4db24/dictator.csv"},"size":3452,"type":"csv"},{"bucket":"ec3ed28f-dbb3-4109-ba38-62a311b4db24","checksum":"md5:3f6a035db9f9aa891e59cb3415409de7","key":"QuestionsAnswersSurvey.xls","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/ec3ed28f-dbb3-4109-ba38-62a311b4db24/QuestionsAnswersSurvey.xls"},"size":26112,"type":"xls"},{"bucket":"ec3ed28f-dbb3-4109-ba38-62a311b4db24","checksum":"md5:8d4a49ef9762725c86206817d58396b9","key":"README.txt","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/ec3ed28f-dbb3-4109-ba38-62a311b4db24/README.txt"},"size":5001,"type":"txt"},{"bucket":"ec3ed28f-dbb3-4109-ba38-62a311b4db24","checksum":"md5:b1c2a7940d4ef4442173a23c32287310","key":"session.csv","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/ec3ed28f-dbb3-4109-ba38-62a311b4db24/session.csv"},"size":178,"type":"csv"},{"bucket":"ec3ed28f-dbb3-4109-ba38-62a311b4db24","checksum":"md5:8e84cca8d34c4d73b2b600f168c75a80","key":"snowdrift.csv","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/ec3ed28f-dbb3-4109-ba38-62a311b4db24/snowdrift.csv"},"size":5469,"type":"csv"},{"bucket":"ec3ed28f-dbb3-4109-ba38-62a311b4db24","checksum":"md5:6ec8c7d5e3286c90f422969933de4b8c","key":"trust.csv","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/ec3ed28f-dbb3-4109-ba38-62a311b4db24/trust.csv"},"size":3673,"type":"csv"},{"bucket":"ec3ed28f-dbb3-4109-ba38-62a311b4db24","checksum":"md5:15dede9e413902cbe81d1475695a3900","key":"user.csv","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/ec3ed28f-dbb3-4109-ba38-62a311b4db24/user.csv"},"size":21709,"type":"csv"}],"id":1308972,"links":{"badge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.1308972.svg","bucket":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/ec3ed28f-dbb3-4109-ba38-62a311b4db24","conceptbadge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.1308971.svg","conceptdoi":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1308971","doi":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1308972","html":"https://zenodo.org/record/1308972","latest":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/1308972","latest_html":"https://zenodo.org/record/1308972","self":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/1308972"},"metadata":{"access_right":"open","access_right_category":"success","creators":[{"affiliation":"Universitat de Barcelona","name":"Julian Vicens","orcid":"0000-0003-0643-0469"},{"affiliation":"Universitat de Barcelona","name":"Anna Cigarini"},{"affiliation":"Universitat de Barcelona","name":"Isabelle Bonhoure"},{"affiliation":"Universitat de Barcelona","name":"Josep Perello","orcid":"0000-0001-8533-6539"}],"description":"<p><strong>STEM4Youth: Games Barcelona.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Data collected during the performance STEM4Youth: Games xBarcelona in Barcelona on September 28th, 2017.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The participants played different dyadic behavioral&nbsp;games, snowdrift game, dictator&#39;s games with punishment and trust game.

increasing water demands. After years of obscurity, the science of IRES has bloomed recently and it is being recognised that IRES support a unique and high biodiversity, provide essential ecosystem services and are functionally part of river networks and groundwater systems. However, they still lack protective and adequate management, thereby jeopardizing water resources at the global scale. This Action brings together hydrologists, biogeochemists, ecologists, modellers, environmental economists, social researchers and stakeholders from 14 different countries to develop a research network for synthesising the fragmented, recent knowledge on IRES, improving our understanding of IRES and translating this into a science-based, sustainable management of river networks. Deliverables will be provided through i) research workshops synthesising and addressing key challenges in IRES science, supporting research exchange and educating young researchers, and ii) researcher-stakeholder workshops translating improved knowledge into tangible tools and guidelines for protecting IRES and raising awareness of their importance and value in societal and decision-maker spheres. This Action is organized within six Working Groups to address: (i) the occurrence, distribution and hydrological trends of IRES; (ii) the effects of flow alterations on IRES functions and services; (iii) the interaction of aquatic and terrestrial biogeochemical processes at catchment scale; (iv) the biomonitoring of the ecological status of IRES; (v) synergies in IRES research at the European scale, data assemblage and sharing; (vi) IRES management and advocacy training.</p>","doi":"10.3897/rio.3.e21774","imprint":{"publisher":"Pensoft Publishers"},"journal":{"issue":"","pages":"e21774","title":"Research Ideas and Outcomes","volume":"3"},"keywords":["Flow intermittence","river networks","water scarcity","hydrological modelling","e-flow management","ecological status assessment","climate change","conservation","management","citizen-science","Water Framework Directive."],"license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"publication_date":"2017-11-01","relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1139904"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1139903"}}]},"resource_type":{"subtype":"article","title":"Journal article","type":"publication"},"title":"Science and Management of Intermittent Rivers and Ephemeral Streams (SMIRES)"},"owners":[1161],"revision":4,"stats":{"downloads":17.0,"unique_downloads":15.0,"unique_views":5.0,"version_downloads":17.0,"version_unique_downloads":15.0,"version_unique_views":5.0,"version_views":5.0,"version_volume":16094172.0,"views":5.0,"volume":16094172.0},"updated":"2019-04-09T13:26:40.450666+00:00"},{"conceptrecid":"779405","created":"2017-05-12T08:03:04.861988+00:00","doi":"10.3897/natureconservation.6.6498","files":[{"bucket":"d23d2f30-7fd4-451c-9917-21f8b663ecd1","checksum":"md5:47a819d9d654e3c120f7d1779963ba5b","key":"NC_article_1349.pdf","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/d23d2f30-7fd4-451c-9917-21f8b663ecd1/NC_article_1349.pdf"},"size":697301,"type":"pdf"},{"bucket":"d23d2f30-7fd4-451c-9917-21f8b663ecd1","checksum":"md5:90413203a1722821fcc60d19d06da822","key":"NC_article_1349.xml","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/d23d2f30-7fd4-451c-9917-21f8b663ecd1/NC_article_1349.xml"},"size":114603,"type":"xml"}],"id":575258,"links":{"badge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.3897/natureconservation.6.6498.svg","bucket":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/d23d2f30-7fd4-451c-9917-21f8b663ecd1","doi":"https://doi.org/10.3897/natureconservation.6.6498","html":"https://zenodo.org/record/575258","latest":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/575258","latest_html":"https://zenodo.org/record/575258","self":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/575258"},"metadata":{"access_right":"open","access_right_category":"success","communities":[{"id":"biosyslit"}],"creators":[{"affiliation":"Leibniz Institute for Research on Evolution and Biodiversity, Berlin, Germany","name":"Hoffmann, Anke"},{"affiliation":"Museum f\u00fcr Naturkunde, Berlin, Germany","name":"Penner, Johannes"},{"affiliation":"MfN, Berlin, Germany","name":"Vohland, Katrin"},{"affiliation":"Aix- Marseille Universit\u00e9, unknown, France","name":"Cramer, Wolfgang"},{"affiliation":"University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom","name":"Doubleday, Robert"},{"affiliation":"Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research - UFZ, Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany","name":"Henle, Klaus"},{"affiliation":"University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia","name":"K\u00f5ljalg, Urmas"},{"affiliation":"Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research - UFZ, Halle, Germany","name":"K\u00fchn, Ingolf"},{"affiliation":"University of Leeds, Leeds, United Kingdom","name":"Kunin, William"},{"affiliation":"Estaci\u00f3n Biol\u00f3gica de Do\u00f1ana, Seville, Spain","name":"Negro, Juan Jos\u00e9"},{"affiliation":"Institute of Biodiversity & Ecosystem Research, Bulgarian\u00a0Academy\u00a0of\u00a0Sciences and Pensoft\u00a0Publishers, Sofia, Bulgaria","name":"Penev, Lyubomir"},{"affiliation":"Estaci\u00f3n Biol\u00f3gica de Do\u00f1ana, Seville, Spain","name":"Rodr\u00edguez, Carlos"},{"affiliation":"University of Eastern Finland, Joensuu, Finland","name":"Saarenmaa, Hannu"},{"affiliation":"Station d'Ecologie Experimentale du CNRS, Moulis, France","name":"Schmeller, Dirk"},{"affiliation":"National Museum of Natural History and Pensoft Publishers, Sofia, Bulgaria","name":"Stoev, Pavel"},{"affiliation":"University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom","name":"Sutherland, William"},{"affiliation":"GBIF, unknown, Denmark","name":"\u00d3 Tuama, \u00c9amonn"},{"affiliation":"Museum f\u00fcr Naturkunde - Leibniz Institute for Research on Evolution and Biodiversity, Berlin, Germany","name":"Wetzel, Florian"},{"affiliation":"Leibniz Institute for Research on Evolution and Biodiversity, Berlin, Germany","name":"H\u00e4user, Christoph L."}],"description":"<p>Biodiversity is threatened on a global scale and the losses are ongoing. In order to stop further losses and maintain important ecosystem services, programmes have been put into place to reduce and ideally halt these processes. A whole suite of different approaches is needed to meet these goals. One major scientific contribution is to collate, integrate and analyse the large amounts of fragmented and diverse biodiversity data to determine the current status and trends of biodiversity in order to inform the relevant decision makers. To contribute towards the achievement of these challenging tasks, the project EU BON was developed. The project is focusing mainly on the European continent but contributes at the same time to a much wider global initiative the Group on Earth Observations Biodiversity Observation Network (GEO BON), which itself is a part of the Group of Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS). EU BON will build on existing infrastructures such as GBIF, LifeWatch and national biodiversity data centres in Europe and will integrate relevant biodiversity data from on-ground observations to remote sensing information, covering terrestrial, freshwater and marine habitats.</p><p>A key feature of EU BON will be the delivery of relevant, fully integrated data to multiple and different stakeholders and end users ranging from local to global levels. Through development and application of new standards and protocols, EU BON will enable greater interoperability of different data layers and systems, provide access to improved analytical tools and services, and will provide better harmonized biodiversity recording and monitoring schemes from citizen science efforts to long-term research programs to mainstream future data collecting. Furthermore EU BON will support biodiversity science-policy interfaces, and facilitate political decisions for sound environmental management, also to help conserve biodiversity for human well-being at different levels, ranging from communal park management to the Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES). Additionally, the project will strengthen European capacities and infrastructures for environmental information management and sustainable development.

The Norwegian Government has funded the project with support from the Indian Government. The project has collaborated with the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) and has implemented several of the capacity building tools, standards and services offered by GBIF. In addition, WII and NHM host the national GBIF- nodes of India and Norway. Furthermore, the project is closely linked to the Indian and international strategies on biodiversity infrastructure development. The project has focused on national user needs, camera trapping techniques, data management, open access and barriers towards open access. Six case studies demonstrate how biodiversity informatics, camera trapping, data mobilization and access policies can contribute to improved decision making. This has led to a better understanding of camera trapping techniques, occupancy modelling, DNA-analysis, species distribution, human-wildlife conflicts, human disturbance effects on wild mammals, habitat recovery, tiger population management needs and investigation of tiger poaching. The project has conducted a minor data repatriation exercise at Norwegian natural history museums. The capacity-building component of this towards international legacy collections is in the description of how to mobilize data through GBIF. WII has developed a national database and a web-portal for mobilizing camera trap data. These developments are important steps towards a national, open biodiversity data management system for camera trap images and their axillary metadata. The project has developed a Best Practice Guide (BPG) for publishing of biodiversity data derived from camera trapping. This BPG will be maintained by GBIF in the future. This capacity-building pilot project has clearly proved relevance in addressing the capacity building needs identified by IPBES. As the project results show, there are many international synergies in capacity-building of biodiversity informatics, camera trapping, data mobilization, data repatriation, data management and data sharing policy improvement. Finalizing the pilot project, the project partners have decided to look for new possibilities for collaboration under the IPBES.</p>","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.999027","keywords":["biodiversity informatics","India","Norway","IPBES","GBIF","citizen science","GIS, Database","wildlife camera trapping","training","capacity building","data sharing","data repatriation","tiger","snow leopard","leopard"],"license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"notes":"DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.999027\nISSN: 1504-3312 \nISBN: 978-82-426-2698-1\nCOPYRIGHT \u00a9 Norwegian Institute for Nature Research The publication may be freely cited where the source is acknowl- edged\nAVAILABILITY [Open]\nPUBLICATION TYPE Digital document (pdf)\nEDITION 1-2012\nQUALITY","publication_date":"2014-10-01","related_identifiers":[{"identifier":"10.5281/zenodo.999026","relation":"isVersionOf","scheme":"doi"}],"relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"999027"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"999026"}}]},"resource_type":{"subtype":"report","title":"Report","type":"publication"},"title":"Capacity building for Intergovernmental Platform for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES).

For this, a method of intercalibration of the data of different missions has been designed, which has provided, as a first result and using data from the DMSP / OLS satellite, the reconstruction of the evolution of public lighting expenditure in Spain between 1992 and 2012, broken down into the different provinces. An analysis of the SNPP / VIIRS / DNB satellite images that have been applied for the determination of public lighting expenditure in the countries of the European Union and to study the variation of light pollution has been carried out as an additional validation of the method. in the municipalities of the Deltebre region. A study of the scientific use of the images taken with digital camera (DSLR) from the International Space Station (ISS) for studies of light pollution has been carried out. It is demonstrated in this work that the type of emitting spectrum of the sources of light pollution can be estimated by color-color diagrams using the three bands of the images and that it is possible to determine the type of lighting technology from the images taken from the ISS. In addition to the classification of sources using synthetic photometry, the absolute photometric calibration of the images was carried out using differential photometry of stellar fields and sources on the ground. As a first step for the scientific exploitation of the nocturnal images of the Earth that are stored in the NASA repository, a citizen science program has been created for the classification, location and geographic referencing of the images. More than 130,000 images have been classified, more than 3000 located, and more than 700 georeferenced. Other methods of capturing nighttime images of sources of light pollution have been explored, such as aerial techniques with hyperspectral and DSLR cameras, from a balloon and using drones. The radiances measured in the images obtained from the satellites have been related to the brightness of the night sky measured from the ground. To gather the necessary information, a method has been developed for the exploration of the spatial variation of the sky brightness that has been applied to the Madrid region, obtaining a map of the sky brightness in the whole region. The temporal variation has been determined with fixed stations of SQM type photometers. Finally, the spectral variation of the sky brightness was determined by continuous monitoring of the sky spectrum in Madrid with the AstMon sky-wide camera and with the SAND spectrograph. This set of measurements constitutes a fundamental data base for the application of models for the diffusion of light pollution through the atmosphere and allows us to conclude that the sky brightness is physically related to the diffuse emission observed in satellite images.</p>","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.1422725","imprint":{"isbn":"978-84-09-03071-2","place":"Madrid","publisher":"Familia S\u00e1nchez de Miguel"},"keywords":["light pollution","remote sensing"],"language":"spa","license":{"id":"CC-BY-NC-4.0"},"notes":"This is a original version","publication_date":"2015-06-15","related_identifiers":[{"identifier":"https://zenodo.org/record/1289896#.WyLj32P7RhE","relation":"isIdenticalTo","scheme":"url"},{"identifier":"10.13140/RG.2.1.2233.7127","relation":"isIdenticalTo","scheme":"doi"},{"identifier":"10.5281/zenodo.1289932","relation":"isVersionOf","scheme":"doi"}],"relations":{"version":[{"count":2,"index":1,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1422725"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1289932"}}]},"resource_type":{"subtype":"thesis","title":"Thesis","type":"publication"},"thesis":{"supervisors":[{"affiliation":"Universidad Complutense de Madrid","name":"Jaime Zamorano Calvo"},{"affiliation":"Universidad Complutense de Madrid","name":"Jesus Gallego Maestro"}],"university":"Universidad Complutense de Madrid"},"title":"Variaci\u00f3n espacial, temporal y espectral de la contaminaci\u00f3n lum\u00ednica y sus fuentes: Metodolog\u00eda y resultados","version":"1"},"owners":[20662],"revision":3,"stats":{"downloads":93.0,"unique_downloads":68.0,"unique_views":96.0,"version_downloads":216.0,"version_unique_downloads":135.0,"version_unique_views":231.0,"version_views":309.0,"version_volume":30709535028.0,"views":111.0,"volume":13225852671.0},"updated":"2019-04-09T13:58:22.055810+00:00"},{"conceptdoi":"10.5281/zenodo.3292460","conceptrecid":"3292460","created":"2019-07-10T10:39:49.442245+00:00","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.3292461","files":[{"bucket":"c1d109f6-30de-40d9-9e45-cf50a3c2f9fb","checksum":"md5:d1a9cbcde1e379a53824fb7ef94d6c5e","key":"Whitaker_IHICodingClub_July2019.pdf","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/c1d109f6-30de-40d9-9e45-cf50a3c2f9fb/Whitaker_IHICodingClub_July2019.pdf"},"size":1602421,"type":"pdf"},{"bucket":"c1d109f6-30de-40d9-9e45-cf50a3c2f9fb","checksum":"md5:5658fecf33b453e4ae662cd09f9060d3","key":"Whitaker_IHICodingClub_July2019.pptx","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/c1d109f6-30de-40d9-9e45-cf50a3c2f9fb/Whitaker_IHICodingClub_July2019.pptx"},"size":48010845,"type":"pptx"}],"id":3292461,"links":{"badge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.3292461.svg","bucket":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/c1d109f6-30de-40d9-9e45-cf50a3c2f9fb","conceptbadge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.3292460.svg","conceptdoi":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3292460","doi":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3292461","html":"https://zenodo.org/record/3292461","latest":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/3292461","latest_html":"https://zenodo.org/record/3292461","self":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/3292461"},"metadata":{"access_right":"open","access_right_category":"success","communities":[{"id":"the-turing-way"}],"creators":[{"affiliation":"The Alan Turing Institute","name":"Whitaker, Kirstie","orcid":"0000-0001-8498-4059"}],"description":"<p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Reproducible research is necessary to ensure that scientific work can be trusted. Funders and publishers are beginning to require that publications include access to the underlying data and the analysis code. The goal is to ensure that all results can be independently verified and built upon in future work. This is sometimes easier said than done! Sharing these research outputs means understanding data management, library sciences, software development, and continuous integration techniques: skills that are not widely taught or expected of academic researchers.&nbsp;<em>The Turing Way</em>&nbsp;is a handbook to support students, their supervisors, funders and journal editors in ensuring that reproducible research is &quot;too easy not to do&quot;.

It is also a prerequisite for successful participation in citizen science, open government, community development, smart healthcare, and social networks. The data revolution has similarly penetrated all areas of frontline and backroom work in libraries and turned research libraries into data-intensive organizations as a result of developments in digital scholarship, bibliometrics and altmetrics, open science, linked open data, learning analytics and data-based decision making. All library workers will increasingly need at least basic competence in dealing with data to contribute effectively in the research library of the future.</p>\n\n<p>Many research libraries have responded to the data challenge by evolving their data literacy support from helping students and faculty to find and use external social data sets to advising on management and sharing of original research data in the context of funder requirements for data management plans. A few libraries have extended the depth and breadth of their data literacy support to cover other areas and involve more library staff via data literacy training. However, our study suggests more radical change in data literacy practice is needed for research libraries to support their communities effectively in the connected data society of the 21st century.</p>\n\n<p>Our research is based on a comprehensive investigation of the impact of data on society and understandings of data literacy among different disciplines, professions, and institutions. We also explored approaches to data literacy education, including information literacy and digital skills practices that could be adopted or adapted to develop data literacy. We supplemented evidence from a variety of literature (research papers, academic textbooks, professional manuals, agency publications, popular treatments, and industry newsletters), with data from project databases and organization websites to capture current thinking and emergent practice in this fast-moving field.</p>\n\n<p>We found significant variation in how different groups and sectors define and position data literacy, which has implications for the scope and focus of library data literacy interventions. We also identified a range of stakeholders as potential collaborators for research libraries in advancing data literacy locally and globally. In addition, we found evidence of research librarians acknowledging responsibility to ensure all staff and students have the digital skills required to be successful in scholarship, employment, and lifelong learning; and another example where librarians successfully delivered an information literacy course helping students to handle information from multiple life perspectives, supporting their information needs across their academic, professional, and personal lives.</p>\n\n<p>We conclude first, that data literacy is an essential competence for all members of society; second, that existing models of data literacy education need to be extended to reflect alternative conceptions of data literacy and cover settings where people interact with data in their personal and social lives; and third, that research libraries are uniquely placed to lead the development of data literacy in society, by virtue of their expertise, structure, and relationships, but should collaborate with salient stakeholders to develop a more diverse and inclusive approach.</p>","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.3259729","license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"publication_date":"2019-06-28","related_identifiers":[{"identifier":"10.5281/zenodo.3259728","relation":"isVersionOf","scheme":"doi"}],"relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"3259729"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"3259728"}}]},"resource_type":{"title":"Presentation","type":"presentation"},"title":"The Social Mission of 21st Century Research Libraries: Building Data Literate Communities"},"owners":[45182],"revision":2,"stats":{"downloads":12.0,"unique_downloads":12.0,"unique_views":21.0,"version_downloads":12.0,"version_unique_downloads":12.0,"version_unique_views":21.0,"version_views":21.0,"version_volume":18202596.0,"views":21.0,"volume":18202596.0},"updated":"2019-06-28T19:05:45.034934+00:00"},{"conceptrecid":"3256770","created":"2019-06-26T04:31:49.625243+00:00","doi":"10.3897/biss.3.35747","files":[{"bucket":"3e9a0efb-4ec6-4a38-a937-2e5d9617b224","checksum":"md5:8a2c687e4c01f0910e47bfa0674704df","key":"BISS_article_35747.pdf","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/3e9a0efb-4ec6-4a38-a937-2e5d9617b224/BISS_article_35747.pdf"},"size":67237,"type":"pdf"},{"bucket":"3e9a0efb-4ec6-4a38-a937-2e5d9617b224","checksum":"md5:f86ae2c4ecbd13cb3f1556dc3f8dba0e","key":"BISS_article_35747.xml","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/3e9a0efb-4ec6-4a38-a937-2e5d9617b224/BISS_article_35747.xml"},"size":10816,"type":"xml"}],"id":3256771,"links":{"badge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.3897/biss.3.35747.svg","bucket":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/3e9a0efb-4ec6-4a38-a937-2e5d9617b224","doi":"https://doi.org/10.3897/biss.3.35747","html":"https://zenodo.org/record/3256771","latest":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/3256771","latest_html":"https://zenodo.org/record/3256771","self":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/3256771"},"metadata":{"access_right":"open","access_right_category":"success","communities":[{"id":"biosyslit"}],"creators":[{"affiliation":"Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU), Uppsala, Sweden|Swedish Species Information Centre (ArtDatabanken, SSIC), Uppsala, Sweden","name":"Sj\u00f6din Skarp, Liselott"}],"description":"<p>The Swedish Species Information Centre (<u>ArtDatabanken, SSIC</u>) at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (<u>SLU</u>) accumulates, analyses and disseminates information concerning Swedish species, habitats and ecosystems.

All systems, including the SLW Analysis Portal (<u>analysisportal.se</u>), rely on recognized standards to ensure interoperability and consist of databases, API:s and portals. The Artportalen platform now contains &gt;69 000 000 georeferenced observations, along with 1 300 000 images, video or sound, of some 32 000 species from Sweden. The data are harvested by SLW and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). In addition to reports from NGOs and the general public, which generate &gt;90% of the observations, a rapidly increasing number of Swedish governmental authorities and agencies are using the platform to store regional and local species inventories collected by standardized scientific methods. There are sophisticated systems for validation and to secure data quality, and the records are used by scientists as well as by county and municipality councils as a principle biodiversity resource in environmental planning and decision making. Data concerning some species considered to be particularly sensitive to disturbance are classified and not openly available. These data can be accessed via a hierarchy of access levels so as to enable such classified data to available to, for example, environmental officers and to be used in management purposes The SSIC has just launched new API:s, modules for improved reporting of species checklists and invasive species, and a new platform aggregating the services in a single web interface and based on responsive design and specific interfaces for different users (<u>artfakta.se</u>).

In addition, the STI supports barcoding activities, scientific courses and announces grants for museums and taxonomic research and inventories within poorly known organismal groups. The Swedish and Norwegian taxonomy initiatives work cooperatively to increase the collective knowledge of poorly known species and, as a result, more than 3 000 species new to Sweden and Norway have been found, approximately a third being new to science.

We recognize the need is critical for a sophisticated system to store, synthesize, use, and share BD data. Accepting and understanding this need is illustrated by the second Global Biodiversity Informatics Conference (GBIC2)\u00a0in 2018 Digital documentation of the BD state is not properly established in the Russian Federation, and a scientific analysis of the basics of monitoring of natural resources and their management have been missing.</p>\n  <p>Contstruction of a comprehensive BD\u00a0database is an obvious step for biologists.

Using thisthis model group, plans are to develop scientific approaches to identify the most important parameters, the analysis and monitoring of which can provide effective knowledge about the composition, spatial distribution, temporal dynamics of the composition, and abundance of this animal group within the country. Once developed, such a system and schema of a monitoring of biological resources can be further transferred with necessary adjustments to other groups of living organisms as well as recommended for use in practical purposes (e.g., conservation, augmentation, efficient use) by the relevant state services.</p>\n  <p>For the first time, we will carry out a comprehensive analysis of the\u00a0bird data\u00a0available to Russian scientists from\u00a0one of the largest Northern Eurasian collections from Lomonosov Moscow State University and Zoological Institute of Russian Academy of Sciences, St.Petersburg, reflecting composition, variation and historical dynamics of the spatial distribution of birds inRussia\u00a0territories\u00a0and adjacent regions over more than two centuries.

Under the supervision&nbsp;of biologists from NRDI GeoEcoMar, in collaboration with the PhD students from Belgium involved in the PRIDE project, a series of interactive and proactive&nbsp;activities were accomplished, aiming at foster a sense of community and environmental responsibility to the young generation. In total, 30 students of 5th&nbsp;grade, with ages between 11 and 12 years were involved. The children from &ldquo;Ciprian Porumbescu&rdquo; School learned how to identify species belonging to the&nbsp;Ponto-Caspian relicts, recognize and understand the negative impact of the invasive species on the Black Sea biodiversity. The children from Mihail Koiciu&nbsp;School, who visited the R/V Mare Nigrum (in custody of the NRDI GeoEcoMar) guided by the ship&rsquo;s commander and biologists from GeoEcoMar, explored&nbsp;the complicated but interesting domain of marine science, helped by explanations and demonstrations on research work in biology and geochemistry. The&nbsp;feedback received from the children, assessed by help of questionnaires specially conceived for the targeted category of age and activities carried out, is&nbsp;presented in the paper. Judging after children&rsquo;s reactions and responses to questionnaires, it makes sense to affirm that the activities achieved their scope<br>\nand these methods of education and awareness are positively perceived by the children from elementary schools.</p>","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.1689711","journal":{"pages":"215-222","title":"Geo-Eco-Marina","volume":"No 23/2017"},"keywords":["Black Sea marine protected areas","ecological education","field activities","questionnaires"],"language":"eng","license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"publication_date":"2017-12-31","references":["Borbe L., Bor\u015f O.M., Chendea C., Kovacs M.

Yet, the tools for exploring and discovering scientific content are often lacking. With traditional, list-based search engines, users have to examine articles and their relationships by hand, which is a time-consuming process.</p>\n\n<p>Open Knowledge Maps is an attempt to transform discovery of scientific knowledge by providing an open, community-driven non-profit system that leverages the digital open science ecosystem. Instead of lists, we propose to use knowledge maps for discovery. Knowledge maps provide an instant overview of a field by showing the main areas of the field at a glance, and papers related to each area. This makes it possible to easily identify useful, pertinent information.</p>\n\n<p>Our goal is to provide a large-scale system of open, interactive and interlinked knowledge maps for every research topic, every field and every discipline. This system will enable people inside and outside of academia to not only get an overview of a field and identify relevant concepts, but also to discover trends, recognize important researchers, and to understand connections between fields.</p>\n\n<p>On our website https://openknowledgemaps.org, users can currently create a knowledge map for a topic of their choice based on either BASE or PubMed. Our software retrieves the 100 most relevant results for a topic and generates a knowledge map based on textual similarity between the records. The map is intended to give users a head start in their literature research.</p>\n\n<p>With this service, we have created a lot of enthusiasm in the community. Our user base has quickly grown: since our launch in May 2016, we have recorded over half a million visits to the site and more than 120,000 maps have been created. Open Knowledge Maps has become an international collaboration with team members, advisors and partners from variety of fields, including research, librarianship, design, software development, citizen science, and the open knowledge and open science movement.</p>\n\n<p>In the future, we want to turn discovery into an open and collaborative process. Most people are currently tackling discovery on their own &ndash; and therefore repeat the same process over and over again. By sharing the results of our discoveries, we can save valuable time and build on top of each other&rsquo;s knowledge; for example, researchers and medical librarians can collaboratively map the newest research on a certain disease and openly share result of their efforts for the benefit of evidence-based practice and patients affected by this disease.</p>\n\n<p>We see research libraries and librarians as central to this vision. The complex collaborative system outlined above cannot be realized without experts on knowledge stewardship and community engagement. Together with the other stakeholders from research and society, including researchers, students, journalists, citizen scientists and many more, we want to create system that enables us to create pathways through science for each other. So that we can all benefit from this unique knowledge.</p>","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.3258106","license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"publication_date":"2019-06-27","related_identifiers":[{"identifier":"10.5281/zenodo.3258105","relation":"isVersionOf","scheme":"doi"}],"relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"3258106"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"3258105"}}]},"resource_type":{"title":"Presentation","type":"presentation"},"title":"Open Knowledge Maps: a Visual Interface to the World's Scientific Knowledge"},"owners":[45182],"revision":2,"stats":{"downloads":58.0,"unique_downloads":52.0,"unique_views":120.0,"version_downloads":58.0,"version_unique_downloads":52.0,"version_unique_views":119.0,"version_views":132.0,"version_volume":211750286.0,"views":133.0,"volume":211750286.0},"updated":"2019-06-27T19:05:45.419097+00:00"},{"conceptdoi":"10.5281/zenodo.3274475","conceptrecid":"3274475","created":"2019-07-09T09:32:28.363727+00:00","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.3274476","files":[{"bucket":"80d096cf-a1c8-45d0-b3a6-49355f60dc96","checksum":"md5:c8d1e97e005318ab96e02b484a5376e5","key":"DS3_DITOs_Capacity_Building_Tools_Results-events-database.csv","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/80d096cf-a1c8-45d0-b3a6-49355f60dc96/DS3_DITOs_Capacity_Building_Tools_Results-events-database.csv"},"size":474572,"type":"csv"}],"id":3274476,"links":{"badge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.3274476.svg","bucket":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/80d096cf-a1c8-45d0-b3a6-49355f60dc96","conceptbadge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.3274475.svg","conceptdoi":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3274475","doi":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3274476","html":"https://zenodo.org/record/3274476","latest":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/3274476","latest_html":"https://zenodo.org/record/3274476","self":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/3274476"},"metadata":{"access_right":"open","access_right_category":"success","communities":[{"id":"ditos"}],"creators":[{"affiliation":"UCL","name":"DITOs consortium"}],"description":"<p>This csv file is the dataset of events that were completed by the DITOs consortium during the 3 year H2020 Coordination and Support Action 1/6/16-31/5/19</p>\n\n<p>It contains the following fields:</p>\n\n<p>Partner - The consortium&nbsp;partner responsible for organising the event</p>\n\n<p>Title - The name of the event</p>\n\n<p>Name of event as described in the DoA - The type of the event as listed in the DoA, or the word &#39;additional&#39;

It is disruptive of routine and can challenge long-held practises. Having been through the procedure and survived, we feel we have a lot of experience to share with other institutions who are considering taking on this challenge. The changes that digitization has made to our institution are positive and the digitization a success, but that is not to say that we would not have done some things differently, were we to repeat the exercise.</p>\n  <p>In 2015 Meise Botanic Garden received a grant from the Flemish Government to upgrade its digitization infrastructure and mass digitize 1.2 million specimens from its African and Belgian Herbaria. The new infrastructure improved our workflow significantly, enabling us to digitize specimens five to ten times faster while also improving their quality.</p>\n  <p>The mass digitization part of the project was split into two parts, imaging and transcription. The contract was awarded and out-sourced to Picturae, who started imaging in May 2016 using a conveyor belt installation. Prior to starting, a significant amount of preparation was required at the herbarium. Within one year, 1.2 million specimens were imaged. The images were captured as TIFF files and stored in triplicate at The Flemish Institute for Archiving (VIAA), while smaller derived JPEG 2000 and JPEG files were generated for day-to-day use.</p>\n  <p>The second part of the project was label transcription. A third of the specimens were transcribed in-house for capturing minimal data (barcode, filing name, collector, collector number &amp; country of origin). This was partly done to reduce costs, but also allowed us to compare in-house to out-sourced transcription. Some 500,000 specimens were transcribed, either completely or partially, by Alembo (subcontracted by Picturae).The remaining 200.000 specimens from our Belgian Herbarium are being transcribed using crowdsourcing. The latter is being realized through the citizen science platform <i>DoeDat</i> (<u>www.doedat.be</u>) that was launched in November 2017.</p>\n  <p>Many lessons have been learnt with respect to implementing mass digitization, both practically and sociologically. Many of the problems encountered during the project could have been avoided by changing the workflow. The addition of extra control points during the process could have reduced problems encountered later in the data capture process. Solving these problems at a later stage was time consuming. Trying to \"save money\" can result in a disruptive workflow, which may lead to a number of costly errors. Mass digitization has fundamentally changed the workflow in our collections and the way in which our herbarium is managed. All images for the African and Belgian collections may be now found on our new virtual herbarium <u>www.botanicalcollections.be</u>.</p>","doi":"10.3897/biss.2.25912","imprint":{"publisher":"Pensoft Publishers"},"journal":{"issue":"","pages":"e25912","title":"Biodiversity Information Science and Standards","volume":"2"},"keywords":["Mass Digitization","transcription","imaging","crowdsourcing","herbarium"],"license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"publication_date":"2018-06-15","relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1296582"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1296581"}}]},"resource_type":{"subtype":"article","title":"Journal article","type":"publication"},"title":"Managing a Mass Digitization Project at Meise Botanic Garden: From Start to Finish"},"owners":[1161],"revision":4,"stats":{"downloads":23.0,"unique_downloads":20.0,"unique_views":8.0,"version_downloads":23.0,"version_unique_downloads":20.0,"version_unique_views":8.0,"version_views":8.0,"version_volume":1206561.0,"views":8.0,"volume":1206561.0},"updated":"2019-04-09T14:00:05.369098+00:00"},{"conceptdoi":"10.5281/zenodo.1186825","conceptrecid":"1186825","created":"2018-03-01T16:45:48.799106+00:00","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.1186826","files":[{"bucket":"9e566fb4-6df0-45c9-a6cd-10e9d2bd4ecf","checksum":"md5:d1674c755fe42e8c4a721d68417d0926","key":"2018-03-02-epfl-invited-talk-coincidence.pdf","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/9e566fb4-6df0-45c9-a6cd-10e9d2bd4ecf/2018-03-02-epfl-invited-talk-coincidence.pdf"},"size":65730759,"type":"pdf"}],"id":1186826,"links":{"badge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.1186826.svg","bucket":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/9e566fb4-6df0-45c9-a6cd-10e9d2bd4ecf","conceptbadge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.1186825.svg","conceptdoi":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1186825","doi":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1186826","html":"https://zenodo.org/record/1186826","latest":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/1186826","latest_html":"https://zenodo.org/record/1186826","self":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/1186826"},"metadata":{"access_right":"open","access_right_category":"success","communities":[{"id":"coincidence"}],"creators":[{"affiliation":"Victoria University of Wellington","name":"Markus Luczak-Roesch","orcid":"0000-0003-4610-7244"}],"description":"<p>In this talk I will introduce Transcendental Information Cascades, a method to understand the temporal dynamics of naturally occurring complex systems.

The extensive Wooton legacy includes herbarium collections that he and his famous student Paul Carpenter Standley (1884\u20131963), prolific botanist and explorer, used for the first <i>Flora of New Mexi</i>co by Wooten and Standley 1915 , along with resources covering botany and range management strategies for the northern Chihuahuan Desert, and an extensive, yet to be digitized, historical archive of correspondence, field notes, vegetation sketches, photographs, and lantern slides, all from his travels and field work in the region. Starting in 1890, the most complete set of Wooton's herbarium collections were deposited in the NMC herbarium at New Mexico State University (NMSU), and his archives, now stored in a Campus library, have together been underutilized, offline resources.</p>\n  <p>The goals of this ongoing project are to secure, preserve, and promote Wooton's important historical resources, by fleshing out the botanical history of the region, raising appreciation of herbarium collections within the community, and emphasizing their unique role in facilitating contemporary research aimed at addressing pressing scientific questions such as vegetation responses to global climate change. Students and the general public involved in this project are engaged through hands-on activities including cataloging, databasing and digitization of nearly 10,000 herbarium specimens and Wooton's archives. These outputs, combined with contemporary data collection and computational biology techniques from an ecological perspective, are being used to document vegetation changes in iconic, climate-sensitive, high-elevation mountainous ecosystems present in southwestern New Mexico. In a later phase of the project, a variety of public audiences will participate through interactive online story maps and citizen science programs such as <i>iNaturalist</i>, <i>Notes from Nature</i>, and <i>BioBlitz</i>. Images of herbarium specimens will be shared via an online database and other relevant biodiversity portals (<i>Symbiota</i>, <i>iDigBio</i>, <i>JStor</i>)</p>\n  <p>Community members reached through this project will be better-informed citizens, who may go on to become new stewards of natural history collections, with the potential to influence policies safeguarding the future of our planet's biodiversity. More locally, the project will support the management of Organ Mountains Desert Peaks National Monument, which was established in 2014 to protect the area's human and environmental resources, and for which knowledge and data are currently limited.</p>","doi":"10.3897/biss.2.25783","imprint":{"publisher":"Pensoft Publishers"},"journal":{"issue":"","pages":"e25783","title":"Biodiversity Information Science and Standards","volume":"2"},"keywords":["Wooton","New Mexico","Botanical History","Historical Ecology","NMC","Herbarium Digitization","Natural History Collections","Biodiversity","Community Engagement"],"license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"publication_date":"2018-06-13","relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1294364"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1294363"}}]},"resource_type":{"subtype":"article","title":"Journal article","type":"publication"},"title":"Shining a New Light on Elmer Ottis Wooton's Legacy Herbarium and Historical Archive: an Exercise to Increase Student Participation while Promoting Public Engagement"},"owners":[1161],"revision":4,"stats":{"downloads":27.0,"unique_downloads":27.0,"unique_views":19.0,"version_downloads":27.0,"version_unique_downloads":27.0,"version_unique_views":19.0,"version_views":19.0,"version_volume":1366983.0,"views":19.0,"volume":1366983.0},"updated":"2019-04-09T13:59:35.721182+00:00"},{"conceptdoi":"10.5281/zenodo.1478971","conceptrecid":"1478971","created":"2018-11-07T08:38:22.831396+00:00","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.1478972","files":[{"bucket":"13ce168d-34c4-40a2-96c3-7e2a27772fde","checksum":"md5:4412ea392fbf492b135de33b3212c1d4","key":"classifications.csv","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/13ce168d-34c4-40a2-96c3-7e2a27772fde/classifications.csv"},"size":608195402,"type":"csv"},{"bucket":"13ce168d-34c4-40a2-96c3-7e2a27772fde","checksum":"md5:775101dc8b3a37ad1516c89631b33dbb","key":"lookup_properties.csv","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/13ce168d-34c4-40a2-96c3-7e2a27772fde/lookup_properties.csv"},"size":45177720,"type":"csv"},{"bucket":"13ce168d-34c4-40a2-96c3-7e2a27772fde","checksum":"md5:aeef5bbe5656ee3919abf2d2b31dcd1c","key":"lookup_timesfits.csv","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/13ce168d-34c4-40a2-96c3-7e2a27772fde/lookup_timesfits.csv"},"size":3025886,"type":"csv"},{"bucket":"13ce168d-34c4-40a2-96c3-7e2a27772fde","checksum":"md5:5685937c10fbdda7b3dd58e72c5c3187","key":"rankings.csv","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/13ce168d-34c4-40a2-96c3-7e2a27772fde/rankings.csv"},"size":11656735,"type":"csv"},{"bucket":"13ce168d-34c4-40a2-96c3-7e2a27772fde","checksum":"md5:fd95ec529f3871ec01bd08adfa2923d2","key":"readme.md","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/13ce168d-34c4-40a2-96c3-7e2a27772fde/readme.md"},"size":8004,"type":"md"},{"bucket":"13ce168d-34c4-40a2-96c3-7e2a27772fde","checksum":"md5:a17dc71ea391ce2aa030b639973e72b0","key":"users_links.csv","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/13ce168d-34c4-40a2-96c3-7e2a27772fde/users_links.csv"},"size":1564,"type":"csv"}],"id":1478972,"links":{"badge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.1478972.svg","bucket":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/13ce168d-34c4-40a2-96c3-7e2a27772fde","conceptbadge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.1478971.svg","conceptdoi":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1478971","doi":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1478972","html":"https://zenodo.org/record/1478972","latest":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/1478972","latest_html":"https://zenodo.org/record/1478972","self":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/1478972"},"metadata":{"access_right":"open","access_right_category":"success","creators":[{"name":"Higgins, P.

Openly developed and community-led, this online book curates resources, case studies and checklists to make reproducible research &quot;Too easy not to do&quot;.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>\n\n<p>Reproducible research is necessary to ensure that scientific work can be trusted. Funders and publishers are beginning to require that publications include access to the underlying data and the analysis code. The goal is to ensure that all results can be independently verified and built upon in future work. This is sometimes easier said than done! Sharing these research outputs means understanding data management, library sciences, software development, and continuous integration techniques: skills that are not widely taught or expected of academic researchers. <em>The Turing Way</em> is a handbook to support students, their supervisors, funders and journal editors in ensuring that reproducible research is &quot;too easy not to do&quot;. It includes training material on version control, analysis testing, and open and transparent communication with future users, and includes case studies and common &quot;gotchas&quot; for researchers to avoid. This project is openly developed and any and all questions, comments and recommendations are welcome at our github repository: <a href=\"https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way\">https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way</a>. In this talk, Kirstie Whitaker, lead developer of <em>The Turing Way</em>, will take you on a whirlwind tour of the chapters that already exist, the interactive demonstrations you can use and re-use for your own research, and the directions in which we&#39;re continuing to develop. All participants will leave the talk knowing that &quot;Every Little Helps&quot; when making their work reproducible, where to ask for help as they start or continue their open research journey, and how they can contribute to improve <em>The Turing Way</em> for future readers.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Bio</strong></p>\n\n<p>Kirstie Whitaker is a research fellow at the <a href=\"https://www.turing.ac.uk/\">Alan Turing Institute</a> (London, UK) and senior research associate in the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Cambridge. Her work covers a broad range of interests and methods, but the driving principle is to improve the lives of neurodivergent people and people with mental health conditions. Dr Whitaker uses magnetic resonance imaging to study child and adolescent brain development and participatory citizen science to educate non-autistic people about how they can better support autistic friends and colleagues. She is the lead developer of <a href=\"https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way\"><em>The Turing Way</em></a>, an openly developed educational resource to enable more reproducible data science. Kirstie is a passionate advocate for making science &quot;open for all&quot; by promoting equity and inclusion for people from diverse backgrounds, and by changing the academic incentive structure to reward collaborative working.

Computers are now able to use images to identify tens of thousands of species across a wide range of taxonomic groups in real time, notably demonstrated by iNaturalist.org, which suggests species IDs to users (<u>https://www.inaturalist.org/pages/computer_vision_demo</u>) as they create observation records. Soon it will be commonplace to detect species in video feeds or use the camera in a mobile device to search for species-related content on the Internet.</p>\n  <p>The Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) has an important role to play in advancing and improving this technology, whether in terms of data, collaboration across teams, or citation practice. But in the short term, the most important role may relate to initiating a cultural shift in accepted practices for the use of GBIF-mediated data for training of artificial intelligence (AI).</p>\n  <p>\"Training datasets\" play a critical role in achieving species recognition capability in any machine vision system. These datasets compile representative images containing the explicit, verifiable identifications of the species they include. High-powered computers run algorithms on these training datasets, analysing the imagery and building complex models that characterize defining features for each species or taxonomic group. Researchers can, in turn, apply the resulting models to new images, determining what species or group they likely contain. Current research in machine vision is exploring (a) the use of location and date information to further improve model results, (b) identification methods beyond species-level into attribute, character, trait, or part-level ID, with an eye toward human interpretability, and (c) expertise modeling for improved determination of \"research grade\" images and metadata.</p>\n  <p>The GBIF community has amassed one of the largest datasets of labelled species images available on the internet: more than 33 million species occurrence records in GBIF.org have one or more images (<u>https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/gallery</u>). Machine vision models, when integrated into the data collection tools in use across the GBIF network, can improve the user experience. For example, in citizen science applications like iNaturalist, automated species suggestion helps even novice users contribute occurrence records to GBIF.</p>\n  <p>Perhaps most importantly, GBIF has implemented uniform (and open) data licensing, established guidelines on citation and provided consistent methods for tracking data use through the Digital Object Identifiers (DOI) citation chain. GBIF would like to build on the lessons learned in these activities while striving to assist with this technology research and increase its power and availability.</p>\n  <p>We envisage an approach as follows:</p>\n  \n    \n      <p>To assist in developing and refining machine vision models, GBIF plans to provide training datasets, taking effort to ensure license and citation practice are respected. The training datasets will be issued with a DOI, and the contributing datasets will be linked through the DOI citation graph.</p>\n    \n    \n      <p>To assist application developers, Google and Visipedia plan to build and publish openly-licensed models and tutorials for how to adapt them for localized use.</p>\n    \n    \n      <p>Together we will strive to ensure that data is being used responsibly and transparently, to close the gap between machine vision scientists, application developers, and users and to share taxonomic trees capturing the taxon rank to which machine vision models can identify with confidence based on an image's visual characteristics.</p>","doi":"10.3897/biss.3.37230","imprint":{"publisher":"Pensoft Publishers"},"journal":{"issue":"","pages":"e37230","title":"Biodiversity Information Science and Standards","volume":"3"},"keywords":["biodiversity species","machine vision","training models"],"license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"publication_date":"2019-06-19","relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"3257870"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"3257869"}}]},"resource_type":{"subtype":"article","title":"Journal article","type":"publication"},"title":"Training Machines to Identify Species using GBIF-mediated Datasets"},"owners":[1161],"revision":2,"stats":{"downloads":5.0,"unique_downloads":5.0,"unique_views":4.0,"version_downloads":5.0,"version_unique_downloads":5.0,"version_unique_views":4.0,"version_views":4.0,"version_volume":333060.0,"views":4.0,"volume":333060.0},"updated":"2019-06-27T07:05:44.842077+00:00"},{"conceptdoi":"10.5281/zenodo.3259732","conceptrecid":"3259732","created":"2019-06-28T08:31:43.143855+00:00","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.3259733","files":[{"bucket":"e2d95d22-2eba-411b-8d6f-933b105d8acd","checksum":"md5:a1e512fae88248792e932c33f3ad8369","key":"Session8.2_HuiTingChung_Liber2019_Thurs_Swift.pdf","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/e2d95d22-2eba-411b-8d6f-933b105d8acd/Session8.2_HuiTingChung_Liber2019_Thurs_Swift.pdf"},"size":1857252,"type":"pdf"}],"id":3259733,"links":{"badge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.3259733.svg","bucket":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/e2d95d22-2eba-411b-8d6f-933b105d8acd","conceptbadge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.3259732.svg","conceptdoi":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3259732","doi":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3259733","html":"https://zenodo.org/record/3259733","latest":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/3259733","latest_html":"https://zenodo.org/record/3259733","self":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/3259733"},"metadata":{"access_right":"open","access_right_category":"success","communities":[{"id":"liber2019"}],"creators":[{"affiliation":"Austrian National Library, Austria","name":"Chung, Hui Ting"}],"description":"<p>As the digital platform for cultural heritage, the Europeana Collections preserve over 50 million digitised items from various libraries, museums and other cultural institutions. With digitisation comes the challenge of transforming these materials into useful and searchable information sources. This is particularly problematic for cultural heritage objects with handwritten texts. Digital images of handwritten documents are holding a lot of information that is not included in the metadata provided. The texts are difficult to decipher and it takes a lot of time to read, search and find them. Currently there are no accurate technical solutions for this problem. Automated Handwriting Recognition is a very difficult and error-prone task and technical solutions with high accuracy for character recognition on heterogeneous datasets are not available yet. Due to the lack of machine-interpretable text, it is not possible to perform a search based on the informational content and the covered topics. Similarly, it is presently not possible to use advanced AI technologies for performing exact automatic text processing. Thus, even with increasing automation, the transition from paper format into digitised items is not possible without human resources.</p>\n\n<p>The Enriching Europeana project fills this gap by developing a crowdsourcing platform that will enable citizen science transcription and enrichment campaigns for a wide variety of digital heritage collections in the Europeana library. The aim is, on the one hand, to transcribe, annotate and translate content that is currently only available in image formats and, on the other hand, to improve the accessibility of Europeana content for a diverse group of people. Manual transcription of text material generates high-accuracy resources, supports a better understanding of materials and allows further reuse. It also facilitates the extraction of additional information such as dates, locations, subjects depicted (e.g. in the case of photos or illustrations) and relations with other resources. The newly created information will be integrated with the original collections and made available for the public user in the portals of Europeana, aggregators and content providers. By round-tripping enriched metadata and transcriptions, the Europeana metadata database will be improved and the improvements will be sustained.</p>\n\n<p>The Enriching Europeana platform can be used by non-specialist end users: transcription and enrichment will become an easy, enjoyable and engaging task to perform and users will take part through gamification with competitions, ranking lists, levels and rewards. In order to bring a mixed user base together and to promote greater cross-generational cooperation in crowdsourcing activities, events, called &lsquo;Transcribathons&rsquo;, will be held during the lifetime of the Enriching Europeana project. A Transcribathon is a marathon-like competition where people form teams and compete against each other in the transcription of selected material within a fixed time. These events provide both a discussion platform and a learning platform.</p>\n\n<p>European citizens will be able to make a meaningful contribution to their shared heritage through joining in the enrichment, transcription and translation activities of Enriching Europeana. By furthering the access to cultural heritage, their personal involvement holds a central role in the formation of European historical narratives.</p>","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.3259733","license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"publication_date":"2019-06-28","related_identifiers":[{"identifier":"10.5281/zenodo.3259732","relation":"isVersionOf","scheme":"doi"}],"relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"3259733"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"3259732"}}]},"resource_type":{"title":"Presentation","type":"presentation"},"title":"Enriching Europeana: the Crowdsourcing Platform of the European Library"},"owners":[45182],"revision":2,"stats":{"downloads":9.0,"unique_downloads":8.0,"unique_views":7.0,"version_downloads":9.0,"version_unique_downloads":8.0,"version_unique_views":7.0,"version_views":8.0,"version_volume":16715268.0,"views":8.0,"volume":16715268.0},"updated":"2019-06-28T19:05:45.230248+00:00"},{"conceptrecid":"3251310","created":"2019-06-21T04:34:55.410743+00:00","doi":"10.3897/biss.3.37068","files":[{"bucket":"e8f2a10a-5506-45ef-9f27-0ac4eb87daf8","checksum":"md5:c7438bafacb6b98c94399f074e1936e5","key":"BISS_article_37068.pdf","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/e8f2a10a-5506-45ef-9f27-0ac4eb87daf8/BISS_article_37068.pdf"},"size":74654,"type":"pdf"},{"bucket":"e8f2a10a-5506-45ef-9f27-0ac4eb87daf8","checksum":"md5:b417c00c4aeada686c5bd89e985b48d9","key":"BISS_article_37068.xml","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/e8f2a10a-5506-45ef-9f27-0ac4eb87daf8/BISS_article_37068.xml"},"size":17428,"type":"xml"}],"id":3251311,"links":{"badge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.3897/biss.3.37068.svg","bucket":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/e8f2a10a-5506-45ef-9f27-0ac4eb87daf8","doi":"https://doi.org/10.3897/biss.3.37068","html":"https://zenodo.org/record/3251311","latest":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/3251311","latest_html":"https://zenodo.org/record/3251311","self":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/3251311"},"metadata":{"access_right":"open","access_right_category":"success","communities":[{"id":"biosyslit"}],"creators":[{"affiliation":"French Institute of Pondicherry, Puducherry, India|French Institute of Pondicherry, Puducherry, India","name":"Dhandapani, Balasubramanian"},{"affiliation":"Strand Life Sciences, Bangalore, India","name":"Rajagopal, Prabhakar"},{"affiliation":"Florida Museum of Natural History, Gainesville, United States of America","name":"Barve, Vijay"},{"affiliation":"Abasaheb Garware College, Pune, Pune, India","name":"Koparde, Pankaj"},{"affiliation":"Universidade de S\u00e3o Paulo, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil","name":"Saraiva, Antonio"}],"description":"<p>In our times of challenged relationships between nature and culture, it is essential that biodiversity conservation in biodiversity-rich areas of the world is ceded priority with recognised urgency.\u00a0 The Convention on Biological Diversity's (CBD)\u00a0Aichi Target 19 states that \"By 2020, knowledge, the science base and technologies relating to biodiversity, its values, functioning, status and trends, and the consequences of its loss, are improved, widely shared and transferred, and applied.\"\u00a0 One of the significant impediments mentioned in achieving the goals of CBD is lack of scientific information, which is substantiated by studies that highlight various gaps such as taxonomic, thematic, spatial and temporal biases in the global knowledge on biodiversity. Behind such global approaches to knowledge and its production, there is a need to establish a biodiversity knowledge commons at the global, regional and national scales.\u00a0</p>\n  <p>Biodiversity informatics is tightly integrated with both fundamental biological sciences and the most recent advances in information technology, which gives it a unique blended quality of an academic discipline and technological practice. This has generated much enthusiasm, where rapid technological progress in biodiversity informatics is witnessed along with large scale threats to biodiversity. Such enthusiastic efforts for biodiversity informatics data and tools, as Peterson et al. (2010) argues, need to be integrated with other overall conceptual frameworks, particularly within ecology and evolutionary biology. In the context of\u00a0the\u00a0Global South, it is important to place the practice and knowledge of biodiversity informatics within the framework of sustainable development, biodiversity conservation, traditional knowledge and development aspirations.\u00a0</p>\n  <p>The emphasis on growth, in the current global economic paradigm, has meant undue stress on natural resources. State institutions in\u00a0the\u00a0Global South, responsible for natural resource and biodiversity conservation, are often found to be silent if not supportive of the dominant development policies. Civil society groups and grass-roots level organisations have taken\u00a0the\u00a0lead in documenting biodiversity at relevant scales, to argue for conservation. It is imperative that citizen science has a growing role to play in environmental assessments (Chandler et al. 2016), mediated through biodiversity informatics. By participating in knowledge production\u00a0and\u00a0overcoming the barriers of scientific legitimacy by collaborating with experts in scientific institutions, civil society science groups play a role in changing the power relations by developing the means to generate independent knowledge (Jalbert 2016), contributing towards a global knowledge commons.\u00a0</p>\n  <p>Limiting factors such as\u00a0a\u00a0data sharing culture, coping with quickly evolving technologies and capabilities, inhibit communities in the Global South from participating in building a global biodiversity knowledge commons. The historically skewed accumulation of knowledge on biodiversity of\u00a0the\u00a0Global South in northern institutions facilitates their influence\u00a0of\u00a0contemporary global policies and allocation of resources. Apart from a few exceptions, such as Biodiversity Information for Development, JRS Foundation's African efforts and Critical Ecosytem Partnership Fund's investments in biodiversity hotspots, one does not see any encouraging shifts in this cyclic trend, which will not be effective in addressing the biases in global biodiversity knowledge. As much as the development of the discipline and practice of biodiversity informatics at different scales is important, it is equally necessary to address such structural aspects that affect the constitution of the global biodiversity knowledge commons and its relevance to the communities in the Global South.</p>","doi":"10.3897/biss.3.37068","imprint":{"publisher":"Pensoft Publishers"},"journal":{"issue":"","pages":"e37068","title":"Biodiversity Information Science and Standards","volume":"3"},"keywords":["biodiversity informatics","knowledge","knowledge commons","Global South","challenges"],"license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"publication_date":"2019-06-13","relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"3251311"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"3251310"}}]},"resource_type":{"subtype":"article","title":"Journal article","type":"publication"},"title":"Global Biodiversity Knowledge Commons and Civil Society of the Global South"},"owners":[1161],"revision":2,"stats":{"downloads":4.0,"unique_downloads":4.0,"unique_views":3.0,"version_downloads":4.0,"version_unique_downloads":4.0,"version_unique_views":3.0,"version_views":3.0,"version_volume":298616.0,"views":3.0,"volume":298616.0},"updated":"2019-06-21T07:05:45.838790+00:00"},{"conceptdoi":"10.5281/zenodo.606840","conceptrecid":"606840","created":"2015-12-21T15:32:28+00:00","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.13906","files":[{"bucket":"03d0fdc3-4fd6-4123-881a-09eff7a0be0b","checksum":"md5:402ad7237400af0c3feb212d8e0de403","key":"Part_B_Wiki4R_1-3_RIA_H2020-EINFRA_final.pdf","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/03d0fdc3-4fd6-4123-881a-09eff7a0be0b/Part_B_Wiki4R_1-3_RIA_H2020-EINFRA_final.pdf"},"size":936565,"type":"pdf"},{"bucket":"03d0fdc3-4fd6-4123-881a-09eff7a0be0b","checksum":"md5:298ac6ec4a715ada8a8414ddaea6390f","key":"Part_B_Wiki4R_4-5_RIA_H2020-EINFRA_final-source.doc","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/03d0fdc3-4fd6-4123-881a-09eff7a0be0b/Part_B_Wiki4R_4-5_RIA_H2020-EINFRA_final-source.doc"},"size":170496,"type":"doc"},{"bucket":"03d0fdc3-4fd6-4123-881a-09eff7a0be0b","checksum":"md5:3996ddda488dbd27bbc7e02f961206d0","key":"Part_B_Wiki4R_4-5_RIA_H2020-EINFRA_final-no-letters.pdf","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/03d0fdc3-4fd6-4123-881a-09eff7a0be0b/Part_B_Wiki4R_4-5_RIA_H2020-EINFRA_final-no-letters.pdf"},"size":398480,"type":"pdf"},{"bucket":"03d0fdc3-4fd6-4123-881a-09eff7a0be0b","checksum":"md5:ba66debb213e74292edbd549ada3fbb2","key":"Part_B_Wiki4R_1-3_RIA_H2020-EINFRA_final-source.doc","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/03d0fdc3-4fd6-4123-881a-09eff7a0be0b/Part_B_Wiki4R_1-3_RIA_H2020-EINFRA_final-source.doc"},"size":732672,"type":"doc"}],"id":13906,"links":{"badge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.13906.svg","bucket":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/03d0fdc3-4fd6-4123-881a-09eff7a0be0b","conceptbadge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.606840.svg","conceptdoi":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.606840","doi":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13906","html":"https://zenodo.org/record/13906","latest":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/13906","latest_html":"https://zenodo.org/record/13906","self":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/13906"},"metadata":{"access_right":"open","access_right_category":"success","communities":[{"id":"wiki4r"},{"id":"zenodo"}],"creators":[{"affiliation":"Museum f\u00fcr Naturkunde Berlin","name":"Mietchen, Daniel"},{"affiliation":"Museum f\u00fcr Naturkunde Berlin","name":"Hagedorn, Gregor"},{"affiliation":"Maastricht University","name":"Willighagen, Egon"},{"affiliation":"Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Madrid","name":"Rico, Mariano"},{"affiliation":"Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Madrid","name":"Gomez-Perez, Asuncion"},{"affiliation":"Universitat Oberta de Catalunya","name":"Aibar, Eduard"},{"affiliation":"Inria","name":"Rafes, Karima"},{"affiliation":"Universite\u0301 Paris-Sud","name":"Germain, C\u00e9cile"},{"affiliation":"The European Library","name":"Dunning, Alastair"},{"affiliation":"Wikimedia Deutschland","name":"Pintscher, Lydia"},{"affiliation":"Wikimedia Deutschland","name":"Kinzler, Daniel"},{"affiliation":"online","name":"Anonymous"}],"description":"<p>Wiki4R will create an innovative virtual research environment (VRE) for Open Science at scale, engaging both professional researchers and citizen data scientists in new and potentially transformative forms of collaboration. It is based on the realizations that (1) the structured parts of the Web itself can be regarded as a VRE, (2) such environments depend on communities, (3) closed environments are limited in their capacity to nurture thriving communities. Wiki4R will therefore integrate Wikidata, the multilingual semantic backbone behind Wikipedia, into existing research processes to enable transdisciplinary research and reduce fragmentation of research in and outside Europe. By establishing a central shared information node, research data can be linked and annotated into knowledge. Despite occasional uses of Wikipedia or Wikidata in research, significant barriers to broader adoption in the sciences or digital humanities exist, including lack of integration into existing research processes and inadequate handling of provenances. The proposed actions include providing best practices and tools for semantic mapping, adoption of citation and author identifiers, interoperability layers for integration with existing research environments, and the development of policies for information quality and interchange. The effectiveness of the actions will be tested in pilot use cases. Unforeseen barriers will be investigated and documented. We will promote the adoption of Wiki4R by making it easy to use and integrate, demonstrate the applicability in selected research domains, and provide diverse training opportunities. Wiki4R leverages the expertise gained in Europe through the Wikidata and DBpedia projects to further strengthen the established virtual community of 14000 people.

Some of these datasets are fairly small, while others are hundreds of terabytes. In this presentation we will describe how the Lab archives these datasets to ensure the data are both loss-less and recoverable in the case of a widespread disaster, how the archival strategy has evolved over the years and explore in detail the current hybrid cloud storage management system.</p>\n  <p>The Lab runs eBird and several other citizen science programs focused on birds where individuals from around the globe enter their sightings into a centralized database. The eBird project alone stores over 500,000,000 observations and the underlying database is over a terabyte in size. Birds of North America, Neotropical Birds and All About Birds are online species accounts comprising a wide range of authoritative live history articles maintained in a relatively small database. Macaulay Library is the world's largest image, sound and video archive with over 6,000,000 cuts totaling nearly 100 TB of data. The Bioacoustics Research Program utilizes automated recording units (SWIFTs) in the forests of the US, jungles of Africa and in all seven oceans to record the environment. These units record 24 hours a day and gather a tremendous about of raw data, over 200 TB to date with an expected rate of an additional 100TB per year. Lastly, BirdCams run by the lab add a steady stream of media detailing the reproductive cycles of a number of species. The lab is committed to making these archives of the natural world available for research and conservation today. More importantly, ensuring these data exist and are accessible in 100 years is a critical component of the Lab data strategy.</p>\n  <p>The data management system for these digital assets has been completely overhauled to handle the rapidly increasing volume and to utilize on-premises systems and cloud services in a hybrid cloud storage system to ensure data are archived in a manner that is redundant, loss-less and insulated from disasters yet still accessible for research. With multimedia being the largest and most rapidly growing block of data, cost rapidly becomes a constraining factor of archiving these data in redundant, geographically isolated facilities. Datasets with a smaller footprint, eBIrd and species accounts allow for a wider variety of solutions as cost is less of a factor. Using different methods to take advantage of differing technologies and balancing cost vs recovery speed, the Lab has implemented several strategies based on data stability (eBird data are constantly changing), retrieval frequency required for research and overall size of the dataset. We utilize Amazon S3 and Glacier as our media archive, we tag each media in Glacier with a set of basic DarwinCore metatdata fields that key back to a master metadata database and numerous project specific databases. Because these metadata databases are much smaller in size, yet critical in searching and retrieval of a required media file, they are archived differently with up to the minute replication to prevent any data loss due to an unexpected disaster. The media files are tagged with a standard set of basic metadata and in the case where the metadata databases were unavailable, retrieval of specific media and basic metadata can still occur.</p>\n  <p>This system has allowed the lab to place into long term archive hundreds of terabytes of data, store them in redundant, geographically isolated locations and provide for complete disaster recovery of the data and metadata.</p>","doi":"10.3897/biss.2.25811","imprint":{"publisher":"Pensoft Publishers"},"journal":{"issue":"","pages":"e25811","title":"Biodiversity Information Science and Standards","volume":"2"},"keywords":["cloud object store deep archive cornell multimedia"],"license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"publication_date":"2018-05-22","relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1255433"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1255432"}}]},"resource_type":{"subtype":"article","title":"Journal article","type":"publication"},"title":"COSA: Cloud Object Storage Archive for deep archival of digital data"},"owners":[1161],"revision":3,"stats":{"downloads":15.0,"unique_downloads":15.0,"unique_views":6.0,"version_downloads":15.0,"version_unique_downloads":15.0,"version_unique_views":6.0,"version_views":6.0,"version_volume":648390.0,"views":6.0,"volume":648390.0},"updated":"2019-04-09T13:47:22.090761+00:00"},{"conceptrecid":"3256758","created":"2019-06-26T04:31:21.559785+00:00","doi":"10.3897/biss.3.35216","files":[{"bucket":"b76b47e2-a7ed-424e-b049-94cbd5bef932","checksum":"md5:e3d08805a25766e87e9bec1902a2dc82","key":"BISS_article_35216.pdf","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/b76b47e2-a7ed-424e-b049-94cbd5bef932/BISS_article_35216.pdf"},"size":83289,"type":"pdf"},{"bucket":"b76b47e2-a7ed-424e-b049-94cbd5bef932","checksum":"md5:f6a742cdecfc0f7611f1b0e5b8c7fba2","key":"BISS_article_35216.xml","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/b76b47e2-a7ed-424e-b049-94cbd5bef932/BISS_article_35216.xml"},"size":14339,"type":"xml"}],"id":3256759,"links":{"badge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.3897/biss.3.35216.svg","bucket":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/b76b47e2-a7ed-424e-b049-94cbd5bef932","doi":"https://doi.org/10.3897/biss.3.35216","html":"https://zenodo.org/record/3256759","latest":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/3256759","latest_html":"https://zenodo.org/record/3256759","self":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/3256759"},"metadata":{"access_right":"open","access_right_category":"success","communities":[{"id":"biosyslit"}],"creators":[{"affiliation":"Micelio, Ekeren (Antwerpen), Belgium","name":"Waagmeester, Andra"},{"affiliation":"University of Virginia, Charlottesville, United States of America","name":"Mietchen, Daniel"},{"affiliation":"Citizen Scientist, Wellington & Wairarapa, New Zealand","name":"Leachman, Siobhan"},{"affiliation":"Meise Botanic Garden, Meise, Belgium","name":"Groom, Quentin"}],"description":"<p>Here we present how two independent infrastructures, Wikimedia and iNaturalist, can be jointly leveraged to improve content on both platforms. iNaturalist.org began as a Master's final project in 2008 and grew to a globally used app to help identify biodiversity. The community behind iNaturalist consists of citizen scientists, who record a species existence through photos or sound recordings. The Wikimedia Foundation provides a spectrum of resources, of which Wikipedia is the most famous sibling. Other siblings we address here are\u00a0Wikimedia\u00a0Commons and Wikidata. Commons is the platform where open licensed media can be shared. Wikidata is the linked knowledge graph, where public data can be stored as structured data. Basically, data goes to Wikidata, images and recordings go to Commons and text goes to Wikipedia. Initially, both Commons and Wikidata served primarily the approximately 300 language versions of Wikipedia. However, nowadays both Commons and Wikidata are also being used as is, that is in other contexts than Wikipedia.</p>\n  <p>Although iNaturalist and the Wikimedia family of repositories thrive as independent infrastructures and are\u00a0thus\u00a0maintained independently from each other, they can be mutually beneficial to each other. Content created by the iNaturalist community can be very valuable to the Wikimedia community.</p>\n  <p>Firstly, observations in the form of\u00a0 photos and sound recordings can be stored on iNaturalist, with an open and compatible license that can provide valuable illustrations and structured knowledge on biodiversity. Wikipedia articles can be enriched with already approximately 1.2M photos from observations. Furthermore, the assertions made by the iNaturalist community can act as references in various Wikidata claims or Wikipedia articles. In many cases in Wikipedia, we have to rely on personal annotations by the picture taker, who stores it on Wikimedia's multimedia Commons. iNaturalist provides images of organisms with stronger - peer-reviewed - assertions on the subject in the picture. When a cat is called a cat in Wikipedia or Commons, it is the iNaturalist community that either approves or rejects that claim.</p>\n  <p>In the opposite direction, iNaturalist relies on knowledge described in Wikipedia.\u00a0It includes Wikipedia articles about taxa on its website. Images can also be uploaded into iNaturalist from Commons. It is therefore possible to add images of museum specimens into iNaturalist to assist with taxon identification.</p>\n  <p>Other citizen science apps do exist. iNaturalist, however, is particularly interesting due to the feature that it allows its users to select from a selection of licenses, of which some are compatible with the licenses upon which content from the Wikimedia family is available. Wikidata uses a CC0 - public - license for its data, Wikipedia is available under a CC-BY-SA and Commons content uses a selection of Creative Commons licenses\u00a0(Table 1).\u00a0iNaturalist is also a particular good fit with Wikimedia, because both have a global and multilingual scope.\u00a0This is a great example of how platforms\u00a0can support each other's missions by simple policy decisions, such as open licencing, that underpin interoperability.</p>","doi":"10.3897/biss.3.35216","imprint":{"publisher":"Pensoft Publishers"},"journal":{"issue":"","pages":"e35216","title":"Biodiversity Information Science and Standards","volume":"3"},"keywords":["crowd curation","iNaturalist","Wikidata","Wikimedia","Creative Commons"],"license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"publication_date":"2019-06-18","relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"3256759"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"3256758"}}]},"resource_type":{"subtype":"article","title":"Journal article","type":"publication"},"title":"Using Crowd-curation to Improve Taxon Annotations on the Wikimedia Infrastructure"},"owners":[1161],"revision":2,"stats":{"downloads":4.0,"unique_downloads":4.0,"unique_views":5.0,"version_downloads":4.0,"version_unique_downloads":4.0,"version_unique_views":5.0,"version_views":5.0,"version_volume":333156.0,"views":5.0,"volume":333156.0},"updated":"2019-06-26T07:05:45.514410+00:00"},{"conceptrecid":"2595706","created":"2019-03-16T05:30:07.295198+00:00","doi":"10.3897/BDJ.7.e33679","files":[{"bucket":"88d7ceea-3d68-41d6-b031-9fcd34527bd0","checksum":"md5:a79e3df3fcca0767b76f40bbcd02510a","key":"BDJ_article_33679.pdf","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/88d7ceea-3d68-41d6-b031-9fcd34527bd0/BDJ_article_33679.pdf"},"size":506992,"type":"pdf"},{"bucket":"88d7ceea-3d68-41d6-b031-9fcd34527bd0","checksum":"md5:dcc998506f466a25e51a8d28e6b344d2","key":"BDJ_article_33679.xml","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/88d7ceea-3d68-41d6-b031-9fcd34527bd0/BDJ_article_33679.xml"},"size":109168,"type":"xml"}],"id":2595707,"links":{"badge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.3897/BDJ.7.e33679.svg","bucket":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/88d7ceea-3d68-41d6-b031-9fcd34527bd0","doi":"https://doi.org/10.3897/BDJ.7.e33679","html":"https://zenodo.org/record/2595707","latest":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/2595707","latest_html":"https://zenodo.org/record/2595707","self":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/2595707"},"metadata":{"access_right":"open","access_right_category":"success","communities":[{"id":"biosyslit"}],"creators":[{"affiliation":"Global Biodiversity Information Facility Secretariat, Copenhagen, Denmark","name":"Hobern, Donald"},{"affiliation":"Instituto de Investigaci\u00f3n de Recursos Biol\u00f3gicos Alexander von Humboldt, Bogot\u00e1, Colombia","name":"Baptiste, Brigitte"},{"affiliation":"Global Biodiversity Information Facility Secretariat, Copenhagen, Denmark","name":"Copas, Kyle"},{"affiliation":"Vertnet, Florida, United States of America|University of Colorado, Boulder; University of Colorado Museum of Natural History, Boulder, United States of America|Univ. of Florida, Gainesville, United States of America","name":"Guralnick, Robert"},{"affiliation":"Global Biodiversity Information Facility Secretariat, Copenhagen, Denmark","name":"Hahn, Andrea"},{"affiliation":"Naturalis, Amsterdam, Netherlands","name":"van Huis, Edwin"},{"affiliation":"Kookmin University, Seoul, South Korea","name":"Kim, Eun-Shik"},{"affiliation":"Monash University, Clayton, Australia","name":"McGeoch, Melodie"},{"affiliation":"African Academy of Sciences, Nairobi, Kenya","name":"Naicker, Isayvani"},{"affiliation":"German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research, Leipzig, Germany","name":"Navarro, Laetitia"},{"affiliation":"Global Biodiversity Information Facility Secretariat, Copenhagen, Denmark","name":"Noesgaard, Daniel"},{"affiliation":"Conservatoire et Jardin botaniques de la Ville de Gen\u00e8ve, Geneva, Switzerland","name":"Price, Michelle"},{"affiliation":"Global Biodiversity Information Facility Secretariat, Copenhagen, Denmark","name":"Rodrigues, Andrew"},{"affiliation":"Global Biodiversity Information Facility Secretariat, Copenhagen, Denmark","name":"Schigel, Dmitry"},{"affiliation":"Smithsonian Libraries/Biodiversity Heritage Library, Washington, DC, United States of America","name":"Sheffield, Carolyn A."},{"affiliation":"VertNet, Bariloche, Argentina|Museum of Vertebrate Zoology, University of California, Berkeley, United States of America","name":"Wieczorek, John"}],"description":"<p>There has been major progress over the last two decades in digitising historical knowledge of biodiversity and in making biodiversity data freely and openly accessible. Interlocking efforts bring together international partnerships and networks, national, regional and institutional projects and investments and countless individual contributors, spanning diverse biological and environmental research domains, government agencies and non-governmental organisations, citizen science and commercial enterprise. However, current efforts remain inefficient and inadequate to address the global need for accurate data on the world's species and on changing patterns and trends in biodiversity. Significant challenges include imbalances in regional engagement in biodiversity informatics activity, uneven progress in data mobilisation and sharing, the lack of stable persistent identifiers for data records, redundant and incompatible processes for cleaning and interpreting data and the absence of functional mechanisms for knowledgeable experts to curate and improve data.</p>\n  <p>Recognising the need for greater alignment between efforts at all scales, the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) convened the second Global Biodiversity Informatics Conference (GBIC2) in July 2018 to propose a coordination mechanism for developing shared roadmaps for biodiversity informatics. GBIC2 attendees reached consensus on the need for a global alliance for biodiversity knowledge, learning from examples such as the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) and the open software communities under the Apache Software Foundation. These initiatives provide models for multiple stakeholders with decentralised funding and independent governance to combine resources and develop sustainable solutions that address common needs.</p>\n  <p>This paper summarises the GBIC2 discussions and presents a set of 23 complementary ambitions to be addressed by the global community in the context of the proposed alliance. The authors call on all who are responsible for describing and monitoring natural systems, all who depend on biodiversity data for research, policy or sustainable environmental management and all who are involved in developing biodiversity informatics solutions to register interest at https://biodiversityinformatics.org/ and to participate in the next steps to establishing a collaborative alliance.</p>\n  <p>The supplementary materials include brochures in a number of languages (English, Arabic, Spanish, Basque, French, Japanese, Dutch, Portuguese, Russian, Traditional Chinese and Simplified Chinese). These summarise the need for an <i>alliance for biodiversity knowledge</i> and call for collaboration in its establishment.</p>","doi":"10.3897/BDJ.7.e33679","imprint":{"publisher":"Pensoft Publishers"},"journal":{"issue":"","pages":"e33679","title":"Biodiversity Data Journal","volume":"7"},"keywords":["Biodiversity","biodiversity data","biodiversity informatics","GBIC2","alliance","collaboration","data quality","sustainability","research infrastructure","open science","open data","investment"],"license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"publication_date":"2019-03-08","related_identifiers":[{"identifier":"10.3897/BDJ.7.e33679.figure1","relation":"hasPart","scheme":"doi"},{"identifier":"10.3897/BDJ.7.e33679.suppl1","relation":"hasPart","scheme":"doi"},{"identifier":"10.3897/BDJ.7.e33679.suppl2","relation":"hasPart","scheme":"doi"},{"identifier":"10.3897/BDJ.7.e33679.suppl3","relation":"hasPart","scheme":"doi"},{"identifier":"10.3897/BDJ.7.e33679.suppl4","relation":"hasPart","scheme":"doi"},{"identifier":"10.3897/BDJ.7.e33679.suppl5","relation":"hasPart","scheme":"doi"},{"identifier":"10.3897/BDJ.7.e33679.suppl6","relation":"hasPart","scheme":"doi"},{"identifier":"10.3897/BDJ.7.e33679.suppl7","relation":"hasPart","scheme":"doi"},{"identifier":"10.3897/BDJ.7.e33679.suppl8","relation":"hasPart","scheme":"doi"},{"identifier":"10.3897/BDJ.7.e33679.suppl9","relation":"hasPart","scheme":"doi"},{"identifier":"10.3897/BDJ.7.e33679.suppl10","relation":"hasPart","scheme":"doi"},{"identifier":"10.3897/BDJ.7.e33679.suppl11","relation":"hasPart","scheme":"doi"},{"identifier":"10.3897/BDJ.7.e33679.suppl12","relation":"hasPart","scheme":"doi"},{"identifier":"10.3897/BDJ.7.e33679.suppl13","relation":"hasPart","scheme":"doi"}],"relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"2595707"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"2595706"}}]},"resource_type":{"subtype":"article","title":"Journal article","type":"publication"},"title":"Connecting data and expertise: a new alliance for biodiversity knowledge"},"owners":[1161],"revision":3,"stats":{"downloads":11.0,"unique_downloads":9.0,"unique_views":13.0,"version_downloads":11.0,"version_unique_downloads":9.0,"version_unique_views":13.0,"version_views":13.0,"version_volume":5179088.0,"views":13.0,"volume":5179088.0},"updated":"2019-04-10T03:27:26.436988+00:00"},{"conceptdoi":"10.5281/zenodo.807358","conceptrecid":"807358","created":"2017-06-13T10:27:21.954408+00:00","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.807359","files":[{"bucket":"498fd7d8-a95f-4ba1-9469-850596e28fd6","checksum":"md5:5f762d4fd9642356114ed8a4a8d797dd","key":"July-2016-1.pdf","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/498fd7d8-a95f-4ba1-9469-850596e28fd6/July-2016-1.pdf"},"size":258368,"type":"pdf"}],"id":807359,"links":{"badge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.807359.svg","bucket":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/498fd7d8-a95f-4ba1-9469-850596e28fd6","conceptbadge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.807358.svg","conceptdoi":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.807358","doi":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.807359","html":"https://zenodo.org/record/807359","latest":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/807359","latest_html":"https://zenodo.org/record/807359","self":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/807359"},"metadata":{"access_right":"open","access_right_category":"success","communities":[{"id":"jaas"}],"creators":[{"affiliation":"School of Civil Engineering and Surveying, Faculty of Health, Engineering, and Sciences, University of Southern Queensland","name":"Javad Asad Poor"}],"description":"<p>Open Design Methodology is defined as a way of preserving the strength and integrity of the design concept while keeping it open for emerging and evolving expectations; hence, is capable of enhancing homemaking in mass housing, especially in developing countries, e.g. Iran and Malaysia whereby end-users are absent during the housing delivery process. This study aims at explaining the implication of Open Design Methodology in enhancing the sense of home in the mass housing through studying end-users\u2019 perceptions of housing physical cues. Accordingly, the collected data through a survey of housing physical cues preferences conducted on 116 Iranian students of Universiti Teknologi Malaysia living at least one year in mass housing apartments was analyzed, using Exploratory Factor Analysis and One Sample t-test. The seven extracted factors from Exploratory Factor Analysis were hierarchically classified into three levels using One Sample t-test. In addressing the aim of the study, the results of One Sample t-test shed light on end-users\u2019 perceptions, making it possible to address two different areas of decision making in mass housing namely professional and ordinary. Dealing with abstract, subjective, complicated, and multidimensional physical cues, the first area is far beyond ordinary end users knowledge, profession, and skill; hence the supervisory role of professionals is highly recommended. The second area deals with concrete and tangible physical features, which has the potential to be left open for end-users\u2019 gradually progressive decision making, and according to their evolving

future risk and timely inform policy in a seamless data-driven workflow. One that is built on open science and open data infrastructures. By using international biodiversity standards and facilities, we would ensure interoperability, repeatability and sustainability. This would make the process adaptable to future requirements in an evolving AS policy landscape both locally and internationally. In recent years, Belgium has developed decision support tools to inform invasive alien species (IAS) policy, including information systems, early warning initiatives and risk assessment protocols. However, the current workflows from biodiversity observations to IAS science and policy are slow, not easily repeatable, and their scope is often taxonomically, spatially and temporally limited. This is mainly caused by the diversity of actors involved and the closed, fragmented nature of the sources of these biodiversity data, which leads to considerable knowledge gaps for IAS research and policy. We will leverage expertise and knowledge from nine former and current BELSPO projects and initiatives: Alien Alert, Invaxen, Diars, INPLANBEL, Alien Impact, Ensis, CORDEX.be, Speedy and the Belgian Biodiversity Platform. The project will be built on two components: 1) The establishment of a data mobilization framework for AS data from diverse data sources and 2) the development of data-driven procedures for risk evaluation based on risk modelling, risk mapping and risk assessment. We will use facilities from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), standards from the Biodiversity Information Standards organization (TDWG) and expertise from Lifewatch to create and facilitate a systematic workflow. Alien species data will be gathered from a large set of regional, national and international initiatives, including citizen science with a wide taxonomic scope from marine, terrestrial and freshwater environments. Observation data will be funnelled in repeatable ways to GBIF. In parallel, a Belgian checklist of AS will be established, benefiting from various taxonomic and project-based checklists foreseen for GBIF publication. The combination of the observation data and the checklist will feed indicators for the identification of emerging species; their level of invasion in Belgium; changes in their invasion status and the identification of areas and species of concern that could be impacted upon by bioinvasions. Data-driven risk evaluation of identified emerging species will be supported by niche and climate modelling and consequent risk mapping using critical climatic variables for the current and projected future climate periods at high resolution. The resulting risk maps will complement risk assessments performed with the recently developed Harmonia+ protocol to assess risks posed by emergent species to biodiversity and human, plant, and animal health. The use of open data will ensure that interested stakeholders in Belgium and abroad can make use of the information we generate. The open science ensures everyone is free to adopt and adapt the workflow for different scenarios and regions. The checklist will be used at national level, but will also serve as the Belgian reference for international databases (IUCN - GRIIS, EASIN) and impact assessments (IPBES, SEBI). The workflow will be showcased through GEO BON, the Invasivesnet network and the COST Actions Alien Challenge and ParrotNet. The observations and outcomes of risk evaluations will be used to provide science-based support for the implementation of IAS policies at the regional, federal and EU levels. The publication of Belgian data and checklists on IAS is particularly timely in light of the currently ongoing EU IAS Regulation and its implementation in Belgium. By proving that automated workflows can provide rapid and repeatable production of information, we will open up this technology for other conservation assessments.</p>","doi":"10.3897/rio.3.e13414","journal":{"issue":"","pages":"e13414","title":"Research Ideas and Outcomes","volume":"3"},"keywords":["Information Technology; Risk Evaluation; Evidence-Based Policy; Open Data Publication; Climate Change"],"license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"publication_date":"2017-05-02","relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"575862"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"780768"}}]},"resource_type":{"subtype":"article","title":"Journal article","type":"publication"},"title":"Tracking Invasive Alien Species (TrIAS): Building a data-driven framework to inform policy"},"owners":[22270],"revision":4,"stats":{"downloads":11.0,"unique_downloads":11.0,"unique_views":6.0,"version_downloads":11.0,"version_unique_downloads":11.0,"version_unique_views":6.0,"version_views":6.0,"version_volume":3816197.0,"views":6.0,"volume":3816197.0},"updated":"2019-04-10T04:07:56.196474+00:00"},{"conceptdoi":"10.5281/zenodo.1125554","conceptrecid":"1125554","created":"2018-01-15T12:52:42.617816+00:00","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.1125555","files":[{"bucket":"32f3661a-a2a7-43d1-bcf5-53844686f7f9","checksum":"md5:80944caafb464201b047742b97b18034","key":"10004930.pdf","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/32f3661a-a2a7-43d1-bcf5-53844686f7f9/10004930.pdf"},"size":302123,"type":"pdf"}],"id":1125555,"links":{"badge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.1125555.svg","bucket":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/32f3661a-a2a7-43d1-bcf5-53844686f7f9","conceptbadge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.1125554.svg","conceptdoi":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1125554","doi":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1125555","html":"https://zenodo.org/record/1125555","latest":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/1125555","latest_html":"https://zenodo.org/record/1125555","self":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/1125555"},"metadata":{"access_right":"open","access_right_category":"success","communities":[{"id":"waset"}],"creators":[{"name":"Shonak Bansal"},{"name":"Prince Jain"},{"name":"Arun Kumar Singh"},{"name":"Neena Gupta"}],"description":"Recently nature\u2013inspired algorithms have widespread use throughout the tough and time consuming multi\u2013objective scientific and engineering design optimization problems.

This has been instrumental in providing evidence to support the development and delivery of key policies.\u00a0<br>\n\u00a0<br>\nHistorically, expertise has been embedded in subjectspecific areas, resulting in data existing in silos with varying degrees of accessibility for those within the department, wider government and wider society. In 2015, Defra\u2019s Secretary of State declared that more than 8000 of Defra\u2019s datasets would be made freely available for anyone to access, use and share. Doing so creates opportunities for everyone \u2013 not just those making their living in food, farming and the environment. Opening access to Defra\u2019s data is intended to both provide opportunities to those who wish to use it to exploit its business potential, and to improve policy delivery by engaging a wider community in solving problems. \u00a0<br>\n\u00a0<br>\nThe Department has been focused on making datasets available as open data; ensuring future data collection and publication approaches are open by default, taking a transparent approach from the outset. This will make it easier to work more collaboratively with other government bodies, external partners and the public. \u00a0<br>\n\u00a0<br>\nAlongside growing support for citizen science activities, new technologies are changing the way in which data flows. This presents opportunities for government as much as for others. Today\u2019s smartphones, for example, have the computing power of the supercomputers of 30 years ago. When coupled with a growing range of accurate sensors,\u00a0<br>\nsmartphones potentially allow the move away from environmental monitoring depending on sparse, fixed, high-accuracy, expensive monitoring stations, replacing them with mobile, cheap, lower accuracy but more densely populated networks, which could be carried on vehicles such as buses or taxis in addition to being supported by the capability of smartphones. \u00a0\u00a0<br>\n\u00a0<br>\nThere is already a move towards crowdsourced data for biodiversity measurement (supported by the National Biodiversity Network). Many people, connected together and using mobile phone technology, could revolutionise country-wide data collection that is sufficient to address policy needs. In future, machine learning may allow species recognition by the smartphone in real time when connected to cloud-based software. This kind of completely integrated software and hardware capability is broadly described by the potential of internet-of things-devices. These have the potential to revolutionise the farm: from making comparisons on productivity, to tracing the journey of food from field to fork.\u00a0<br>\n\u00a0<br>\nDefra is also explore the use of real-time data from earth observation and remote sensing to respond to incidents such as floods, invasive species, pollution and epidemics affecting livestock. Opportunities form these types of data sources are often balanced by challenges associated with transforming systems to be more data-driven and to ensure that, in areas that are business-critical, the data sources are assured. \u00a0<br>\n\u00a0<br>\nComplex decision-making is already supported by modelling that often requires data flows from multiple sources. Machine learning has the potential to increase the automation and speed of data assimilation in to models For example, this could mean using these technologies to inform policies that reward farmers for acting in ways that maximise positive national outcomes. In this particular instance and more widely, however, this comes at the risk of taking human subjectivity and its political and moral weight out of processes. \u00a0<br>\n\u00a0<br>\nIn future data volumes will be a major challenge. While compression algorithms may improve it is not going to be possible to store all raw data. This is going to require real-time processing of data to provide intermediate outputs. Judgements will need to be made about what data needs to be kept and how to implement intelligent compression focused on the ultimate use. \u00a0<br>\n\u00a0<br>\nThe main ethical challenges around data concern personal information, including observance of legislation on data protection and more recent legislation on the right to be forgotten. Defra is working both internally, among its network of agencies, and with its data users to ensure these rights are fully respected. However, data ethics extends beyond just consideration of personal data:\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0<br>\n\u00a0<br>\nthere are sensitivities around some datasets for which Defra shares custody, and others where there are implications for civic, national or cyber security. Some data are also commercially sensitive. There may be additional sensitivities where data concerns reporting of environmental monitoring and enforcing regulation.\u00a0<br>\n\u00a0<br>\nFunding reforms have also been a major driver for change. Finding innovative ways to save money, but deliver a high quality service, remains a departmental mission \u2013 new data policies can help to transform some of the department\u2019s ways of working. Adopting an \u2018open by default\u2019 approach has impacts beyond data, as working openly allows more efficient collaborative working that avoids duplication, saves money, and allows crosspollination of ideas across the Defra group.\u00a0<br>\n\u00a0<br>\nDefra is looking more broadly at how to obtain, analyse and manage data (tools, techniques and storage) to further drive innovation. This has been demonstrated by the recently established Earth Observation Centre of Excellence. This centre aims to ensure satellite data is used to its full potential in policy development and operations across Defra by 2020, via a collaborative group of Defra organisations and external partners. A recent success was during the severe weather in December 2015: the centre facilitated better involvement and communication across departments on flood estimates of non-urban areas using radar

scope</strong></p>\n\n<p>The&nbsp;European Alien Species Information Network team (EASIN, http://easin.jrc.ec.europa.eu) of the Joint Research Centre (JRC) requests&nbsp;the European member states to provide and verify the baseline distribution data of invasive alien species of Union Concern (Tsiamis et al. 2017) as provided by the EASIN mapping system (Katsanevakis et al. 2012). These are species with documented biodiversity impacts sensu the European Union Regulation on the prevention and management of the introduction and spread of Invasive Alien Species in Europe (IAS Regulation No 1143/2014) (European Union 2014). The purpose of this baseline is to set a representative geographic account of the distribution of these species at (i) country and (ii) 10km<sup>2</sup> grid level before the entry into force of the Regulation (and the listing of species through implementing regulations). This distribution provides the baseline for subsequent reporting by the member states as required by the IAS Regulation.</p>\n\n<p>The dataset provides a shapefile on the baseline distribution of the invasive species of EU concern in Belgium based on an aggregated dataset (<em>ias_belgium_t0_xxxx</em>). Data were compiled from various datasets holding invasive species observations such as data from research institutes and research projects (76%), citizen science observatories (23%) and a range of other sources (1%) such as&nbsp;governmental agencies, water managers, invasive species control companies, angling and hunting organizations&nbsp;etc. Data were normalized using a custom mapping of the original data files to Darwin Core (Wieczorek et al. 2012) where possible. Species names were mapped to the GBIF Backbone Taxonomy (GBIF 2016) using the species API (http://www.gbif.org/developer/species). Appropriate selection of records was performed based on predefined cut-off dates (see data range) and record content validation (see validation procedure). Data were then joined with GRID10k layer Belgium based on GRID10k cellcodes (ETRS_1989_LAEA).</p>\n\n<p><strong>File description</strong></p>\n\n<p>The dataset contains two types of data:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Shapefiles (<em>ias_belgium_t0_2016.zip&nbsp;and&nbsp;ias_belgium_t0_2018.zip</em>) providing the presence of the species of EU concern at 10km<sup>2</sup> (European Terrestrial Reference System projection - 1989 ETRS_1989_LAEA) level. The attributes table field &ldquo;ACCEPTED&rdquo; provides coded information on the distribution validation: correct squares (Y) represent data overlapping between the collated baseline data for Belgium and the EASIN maps. Incorrect data (N) can represent records mapped on wrong 10km2 squares, non-validated records or records that fall outside of the date range applied. New squares (New) represent previously unpublished data that were absent from EASIN. The work was supervised and validated by the Belgian national scientific council on invasive alien species, an official consultative structure coordinating scientific input and data aggregation between Belgian regions and institutions with regards to technical implementation of the Regulation No 1143/2014 on invasive alien species.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>A geojson version of the same shapefiles (<em>ias_belgium_t0_2016.geojson </em>and&nbsp;<em>ias_belgium_t0_2018.geojson</em>), in WGS84 projection.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>Date range</strong></p>\n\n<p>The baseline distribution&nbsp;reflects the current status and situation of the IAS of Union concern in Belgium. Historical records were not taken into consideration for the baseline. The choice of cut-off date was based on an analysis of the relative contribution of a year in defining the total distribution of the species at 1km<sup>2</sup> grid level (calculated as [the sum of unique UTM 1km<sup>2</sup> grid squares year-1/total number of unique UTM &nbsp;1km<sup>2</sup> grid squares for that species]) based on the complete dataset.&nbsp;The dataset comprises observations of Union List invasive species between January 2000 (2000-01-01) and February 2016 (2016-01-31) for the species of the first batch (<em>ias_belgium_t0_2016.zip</em>) and between January 2000 (2000-01-01) and August 2017 (2017-08-31) for the species of the first update of the Union List (<em>ias_belgium_t0_2018.zip</em>). They include&nbsp;both casual data as well as established populations and also comprise&nbsp;data from eradicated populations during that period.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Validation procedure</strong></p>\n\n<p>Record validation was performed to exclude dubious records, wrong identifications etc. This was done based on the IdentificationVerificationStatus field (to which validation information from original data were mapped) if available. In general, non-validated data were not considered for ias_belgium_t0_xxxx. Data were validated in the original datasets based on evidence (e.g. pictures), on the observer&rsquo;s experience, or based on a set of predefined rules (e.g. automated validation based on geographic filtering). Data from research institutes were generally considered validated. A few casual records of EU list species that were clearly planted were discarded manually. When the original dataset did not mention any validation status, records were not considered validated and therefore not taken into account for ias_belgium_t0_xxxx, unless for Chinese mitten crab <em>Eriocheir sinensis</em>, ruddy duck <em>Oxyura jamaicensis</em>, raccoon <em>Procyon lotor</em>, Siberian ground squirrel <em>Tamias sibiricus</em>, sacred ibis <em>Threskiornis aethiopicus</em>, and red-eared slider <em>Trachemys spp</em>. For these species, we assumed all records were correct as they originate from dedicated sampling (<em>E. sinensis</em>) within research projects or represent species that are readily recognizable by people in the field. Likewise, for the second batch species, all records of Egyptian goose <em>Alopochen aegyptiaca, </em>Himalayan balsam&nbsp;<em>Impatiens glandulifera</em>,&nbsp;giant hogweed <em>Heracleum mantegazzianum&nbsp;</em>and muskrat <em>Ondatra zibethicus</em> (mostly derived from public eradication services) were considered validated and taken into account.</p>\n\n<p>A visual check was performed on the resulting distribution maps by representatives of the national IAS scientific council. Data in the distribution maps provided by EASIN but not present in ias_belgium_t0_xxxx&nbsp;were carefully checked and kept/rejected accordingly.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Data providers</strong></p>\n\n<p>The providers of the invasive species data for this exercise (individuals and their respective organizations) are listed in the &quot;data providers&quot; section of the dataset metadata. Much of the primary occurrence data that formed the basis for this aggregated dataset will be published as open data on the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) within the framework of the <strong>Tracking Invasive Alien Species project (TrIAS, https://osf.io/7dpgr/,&nbsp;2017-2020)</strong>.</p>","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.1288628","keywords":["biodiversity","invasive alien species","biological invasions","Europe","Regulation","EASIN","Belgium"],"language":"eng","license":{"id":"CC0-1.0"},"publication_date":"2018-06-13","references":["Tsiamis K, Gervasini E, Deriu I, D`amico F, Nunes A, Addamo A, De Jesus Cardoso A.

Being the largest ecosystem supporting life on Earth, it is paramount we maintain and restore its health in a global context. Thus, the Ocean needs to be present on every agenda for the sustainable development of the world&rsquo;s population, societies and economies. This manifesto advocates for the increased understanding, protection and management of the Ocean to support the health and well-being of present and future generations.</p>\n\n<p>MANAGE OCEAN COMPLEXITY</p>\n\n<p>The Ocean is by far the largest reservoir of heat in the global climate system and exerts a fundamental contribution in regulating global warming over short (decades) and long (millennia) time scales. Human population growth and climate change are major drivers acting on all ecosystems, with the Ocean being no exception. Increasing temperatures at all depths, acidification, sea level rise, loss of biodiversity, migration of species and habitat destruction and degradation are all consequences of these drivers. Hence, it is necessary that cumulative human pressures (e.g. pollution, plastics, maritime traffic, overfishing, aquaculture, eutrophication, seabed mining, introduced species), the interactions of stressors, and their combined effects on Ocean ecosystem composition and function are understood, assessed and sustainably managed to allow the same opportunities from the Ocean for our future generations. A systemic approach for the integrated assessment of the state of marine ecosystems and the resilience to cumulative pressures is key to promoting the responsible use of marine resources without compromising the future of our Ocean and consequently the future of humankind.</p>\n\n<p>We need to understand and assess the complex interactions of marine systems, anthropogenic drivers and the role of global cumulative impacts with regard to the provision of goods and services in a changing environment. A safe and resilient Ocean will provide more food and other societal benefits, including increased employment, without compromising our future.</p>\n\n<p>SECURE COASTAL AREAS</p>\n\n<p>Global mean sea level is expected to rise by the end of this century and will have a direct impact on coastal areas which currently accommodate over 40% of the world&rsquo;s populations. This coastal population is increasing disproportionally and it is expected that the majority of future megacities will be located on the coast. These are also areas that sustain keystone breeding and nursery habitats for commercial seafood stocks, have important carbon sequestration functions and constitute the major focus for commercial, aesthetic and touristic activities. The future will thus pose several challenges for the management of coastal areas, from the huge increase in anthropogenic pressures to the need for reconversion and adaptation of present day urban infrastructures. Today, we have the opportunity to develop and demonstrate new nature-based and smart eco-engineering solutions for the sustainable development of our marine urban areas, thereby safeguarding our future well-being.</p>\n\n<p>We must create innovative and coordinated solutions for safe, inclusive, smart, resilient and sustainable marine urban spaces. New monitoring, conservation and restoration measures of marine urban spaces should expand the &ldquo;Blue&rdquo; component of present day &ldquo;Grey&rdquo; cities, to benefit local populations and global Ocean health.</p>\n\n<p>TARGET OCEAN AND HUMAN HEALTH</p>\n\n<p>Oceans can affect human health in many ways through ingestion of pathogenic microbes or algal toxins, or exposure to toxic chemicals such mercury, lead and pesticides that can cause severe illness. Oceans can also provide enormous human and industrial benefits, through the provision of protein, pharmaceuticals, biofuels and more which in turn support jobs and national economies. A healthier Ocean that is better managed could ensure that the benefits from the exploitation of Ocean resources are sustainably and equitably shared. However, we still face significant gaps in our knowledge of the Ocean. We still have not determined how to balance its opportunities while nurturing the health of its ecosystems. Many species in marine ecosystems are not yet described, and their ecological role and associated services not identified. Just as the study of the human microbiome has revolutionized the field of human health, the study of the Ocean microbiome opens up a new field of discoveries and knowledge. Ocean microbiomes and connectivity between ocean regions are major drivers of biogeochemical processes and play an essential but still poorly understood role in the functioning of marine ecosystems. A better understanding of the complex interactions between oceans and human well-being could allow for the better management of marine resources while preserving all the Ocean ecosystem services provided to our societies.</p>\n\n<p>There is a need to achieve global healthy oceans by characterizing major ecosystems and&nbsp; understanding the functioning and connectivity of local marine ecosystems to: (a) preserve and enhance associated Ocean services such as increased provision of food, discovering new pharmaceutical products, developing renewable sources of energy, improving recreation and transport; (b) maintain and increase all the cultural and aesthetic services provided to future societies.</p>\n\n<p>PROTECT OCEAN COMMONS</p>\n\n<p>Societies and individuals across the globe benefit from the natural and cultural benefits and services provided by the Ocean. The distribution of these &ldquo;Ocean commons&rdquo; is changing. The melting Arctic ice cap, reduction of wild seafood provision, emergence of harmful pathogens and parasites, and previously inaccessible Ocean spaces (e.g. the deep sea) now increasingly within human reach, are challenges that need to be addressed by responsible Ocean governance to reduce the potential for conflict at all levels and ensure human well-being. Current knowledge on how to relate and govern Ocean dynamics and associated societal changes is fragmented, and observations of resource distribution and dynamics are scant and insufficiently accessible. We need to advance theory, observations and modelling of the complex global Ocean to forecast, manage and mitigate these changes. New platforms, sensors, methods, holistic approaches (e.g., systems biology, meta-omics, and ecosystem approaches) and novel theoretical frameworks linking evolutionary theory and oceanography as well as marine social sciences and humanities can provide an integrated framework to inform decision making on the governance of the Ocean commons. Empowering Ocean observations (e.g., citizen science framework, robotics, artificial intelligence) and robust science-based thinking at national and international levels will promote diplomacy and wider societal actions to support responsible and sustainability-enhancing Ocean governance.</p>\n\n<p>Better predictions, observations and theory are needed to manage and share the &ldquo;Ocean commons&rdquo; in a fair and responsible way under the present global challenges. These will also ensure that the benefits from the exploitation of Ocean resources can be sustainably managed and equitably shared.</p>","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.1494917","grants":[{"acronym":"EUROMARINE","code":"265099","funder":{"acronyms":["EC"],"doi":"10.13039/501100000780","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/funders/10.13039/501100000780"},"name":"European

Squirrels are prominent among invasive alien species in Italy with four species introduced. Three of them are included within the list of alien species of European concern and their eradication and control is recommended. However, their local control is not an easy task, being highly appreciated by the general public. We<br>\npropose a socio-ecological approach to evaluate the feasibility of eradicating Siberian chipmunks (<em>Eutamias sibiricus</em>) populations. We performed a structured questionnaire to assess the social perception of invasive Siberian chipmunks in urban parks where they occur and to identify groups of visitors who might oppose eradication. We also carried out geographic profiling to test for the spatial expansion of chipmunk populations. Overall, park visitors regarded chipmunks positively and appreciated to see them, but human-chipmunk interactions were still rare. We did not identify any group of visitors with a strong attachment to chipmunks, who might oppose future control programs. Geographic profiling showed that chipmunks in Valeggio sul Mincio are starting to expand outside of their introduction site. Data from questionnaires show that chipmunks eradication, coupled with adequate communication initiatives, might be feasible. Moreover, geographic profiling indicates that time for a rapid removal is running out. Socio-ecological approaches, combining the analysis of structured questionnaires administered to stakeholders and statistical modeling of pest observations, could be a valuable tool to decide the feasibility and the urgency of invasive pest control.</p>","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.2556592","language":"eng","license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"notes":"This preprint has already been archived on bioRxiv","publication_date":"2019-01-30","references":["Mori E , Zozzoli R, Menchetti M, Global distribution and status of introduced Siberian chipmunks Eutamias sibiricus.

reasons, the backlog of seized devices has increased to unparalleled levels, sometimes leading to years of delays in the trial process, even for online child abuse investigations. In addition to child abuse materials, the digital belongings of an abuser might contain small yet important pieces of information, such as nicknames, e-mails and place names. A thorough digital examination and an appropriate analysis of this set of information might reveal the exact locations or the real identities of criminal associates or victimized children. All these digital clues should be investigated properly through open sources, to identify the real identities of possible owners and discover whether their relationships with the suspect are crime-related. Considering the fact that thousands of such digital traces are present in all seized material for each separate investigation, a thorough examination of every piece of information related to a criminal case becomes a tremendously challenging issue for law enforcement agencies (LEAs). While the resources of LEAs are clearly insufficient, automated methods alone are not adequate to respond fully to current needs. In this regard, this article proposes a new and unorthodox way of handling the ever-growing workload of online child abuse investigators more effectively, by tapping into the energy of a carefully selected crowd of volunteers. After a brief literature review on related subjects, such as open source intelligence (OSINT) and crowdsourcing, in terms of their technical, legal and organizational aspects, the proposed theoretical model will be elaborated. Likely concerns and probable bottlenecks relating to the same respective aspects regarding successful actualization of the model will be identified and thoroughly discussed.</em></p>","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.1467897","journal":{"issue":"1","pages":"206-229","title":"International Journal of Cyber Crimninology","volume":"12"},"keywords":["OSINT, Crowdsourcing, Digital Forensics, Online Child Sexual Abuse, Criminal Investigations."],"license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"publication_date":"2018-10-21","references":["A\u00e7ar, K.

In only one year, this project was taken from crowd-sourcing the design team and developing the briefing to the launch of the Heineken concept club at the Salone del Mobile 2012 in Milan.</p>","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.2604828","keywords":["co-creation","consumer journey map","service design","online research community","interactive infographic"],"license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"publication_date":"2019-03-24","related_identifiers":[{"identifier":"10.5281/zenodo.2604827","relation":"isVersionOf","scheme":"doi"}],"relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"2604828"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"2604827"}}]},"resource_type":{"subtype":"conferencepaper","title":"Conference paper","type":"publication"},"title":"Nightlife Journey of Clubbers Inspires Emerging Designers to Develop a Visionary Concept Club"},"owners":[62060],"revision":2,"stats":{"downloads":8.0,"unique_downloads":6.0,"unique_views":8.0,"version_downloads":8.0,"version_unique_downloads":6.0,"version_unique_views":8.0,"version_views":8.0,"version_volume":2288104.0,"views":8.0,"volume":2288104.0},"updated":"2019-03-25T01:33:03.581454+00:00"},{"conceptrecid":"610339","created":"2015-06-26T15:01:28+00:00","doi":"10.1186/s13742-015-0066-5","files":[{"bucket":"9030a5d9-14c8-4d01-ae6a-052695ca2b11","checksum":"md5:126a754e3002a026c20ce56d2d527633","key":"OSD_paper.pdf","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/9030a5d9-14c8-4d01-ae6a-052695ca2b11/OSD_paper.pdf"},"size":785068,"type":"pdf"}],"id":18909,"links":{"badge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.1186/s13742-015-0066-5.svg","bucket":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/9030a5d9-14c8-4d01-ae6a-052695ca2b11","doi":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s13742-015-0066-5","html":"https://zenodo.org/record/18909","latest":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/18909","latest_html":"https://zenodo.org/record/18909","self":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/18909"},"metadata":{"access_right":"open","access_right_category":"success","communities":[{"id":"ecfunded"}],"creators":[{"affiliation":"Max Planck Institute for Marine Microbiology, Celsiusstrasse 1, Bremen, D-28359, Germany","name":"Kopf, Anna"},{"affiliation":"University of Oxford, 7 Keble Road, Oxford, OX1 3QG, Oxfordshire, UK ","name":"Bicak, Mesude"},{"affiliation":"Max Planck Institute for Marine Microbiology, Celsiusstrasse 1, Bremen, D-28359, Germany","name":"Kottmann, Renzo"},{"affiliation":"Max Planck Institute for Marine Microbiology, Celsiusstrasse 1, Bremen, D-28359, Germany","name":"Schnetzer, Julia"},{"affiliation":"Jacobs University Bremen gGmbH, Campus Ring 1, Bremen, D-28759, Germany ","name":"Kostadinov, Ivaylo"},{"affiliation":"Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, MacLean Building, Benson Lane, Crowmarsh Gifford, Wallingford, OX10 8BB, Oxfordshire, UK ","name":"Lehmann, Katja"},{"affiliation":"Max Planck Institute for Marine Microbiology, Celsiusstrasse 1, Bremen, D-28359, Germany","name":"Fernandez-Guerra, Antonio"},{"affiliation":"CNRS & Sorbonne Universit\u00e9s, UPMC Univ Paris 06, Station Biologique, Place Georges Teissier, Roscoff, F-29680, France ","name":"Jeanthon, Christian"},{"affiliation":"Israel Oceanographic and Limnological Research, National Institute of Oceanography, Tel- Shikmona, POB 8030, Haifa, 31080, Israel ","name":"Rahav, Eyal"},{"affiliation":"Jacobs University Bremen gGmbH, Campus Ring 1, Bremen, D-28759, Germany ","name":"Ullrich, Matthias"},{"affiliation":"Alfred Wegener Institute, Biologische Anstalt Helgoland, Kurpromenade 201, Helgoland, 27498, Germany ","name":"Wichels, Antje"},{"affiliation":"Alfred Wegener Institute, Biologische Anstalt Helgoland, Kurpromenade 201, Helgoland, 27498, Germany ","name":"Gerdts, Gunnar"},{"affiliation":"Hellenic Centre for Marine Research, Institute of Marine Biology, Biotechnology and Aquaculture, Gournes Pediados, Heraklion, 71500, Crete, Greece ","name":"Polymenakou, Paraskevi"},{"affiliation":"Hellenic Centre for Marine Research, Institute of Marine Biology, Biotechnology and Aquaculture, Gournes Pediados, Heraklion, 71500, Crete, Greece ","name":"Kotoulas, Giorgos"},{"affiliation":" Biology Department and YJ-Science and Technology Research Center, American University in Cairo, New Cairo 11835, Cairo Governorate, Egypt ","name":"Siam, Rania"},{"affiliation":" Biology Department and YJ-Science and Technology Research Center, American University in Cairo, New Cairo 11835, Cairo Governorate, Egypt ","name":"Abdallah Rehab Z.

Dataset documentation --</strong></p>\n\n<p><br>\n<strong>1- Introduction</strong></p>\n\n<p>The present dataset was developed in the context of our work in [1] that focus on the automatic recognition of beehive sounds. The problem is posed as the classification of sound segments in two classes: Bee and noBee. The novelty of the explored approach and the need for annotated data, dictated the construction of such dataset.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2- Description</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>2.1- Audio recordings:</strong></p>\n\n<p>The annotated dataset was developed based on a selected set of recordings acquired in the context of two different projects: the Open Source Beehive (OSBH) project [2] and the NU-Hive project [3]. Both projects main goal is to develop a beehive monitoring system capable of identifying and predict certain events and states of the hive that are of interest to the beekeeper. Among many different variables that can be measured and that help the recognition of different states of the hive, the analysis and use of the sound the bees produce is a big focus for both projects.</p>\n\n<p>The recordings from the OSBH project were acquired through a citizen science initiative which asked people from the general public to record the sound from their beehives together with the registering of the hive state at the moment. Because of the amateur and collaborative nature of this project, the recordings from the OSBH project present great diversity due to the very different conditions in which the signals were acquired: different recording devices used, different environments where the hives were placed, and even different position for the microphones inside the hive. This variety of settings makes this dataset a very interesting tool to help evaluate and challenge the methods developed.</p>\n\n<p>The NU-Hive project is a comprehensive effort of data acquisition, concerning not only sound, but a vast amount of variables that will allow the study of bees behaviors and other unknown aspects. The selected recordings are taken from 2 hives and labeled regarding two states: queen bee is present, and queen bee not present. Contrary to the OSBH project recordings, the recordings from&nbsp;the NU-Hive project are from a much more controlled and homogeneous environment. Here the occurring external sounds are mainly traffic, car honks and birds.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The annotated dataset:</strong></p>\n\n<p>For each selected recording, time segments are labeled as Bee or noBee depending on the perceived source of the sound signal being from bees or external to the hive.</p>\n\n<p>The whole annotated dataset consists of 78 recordings of varying lengths which make up for a total duration of approximately 12 hours of which 25% is annotated as noBee events.</p>\n\n<p>About 60% of the recordings are from the NU-Hive dataset and represent 2 hives, the remaining are recordings from the OSBH dataset and 6 different hives. The recorded hives are from 3 main locations: North America, Australia and Europe.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>2- Annotation procedure<a href=\"http://localhost:8888/notebooks/Dropbox/QMUL/BEESzzzz/Data/Annotations/readme.ipynb#2--Annotation-procedure\">&para;</a></strong></p>\n\n<p>The annotation procedure consists in hearing the selected recordings and marking the beginning and the end of every sound that could not be recognized as a beehive sound. The recognition of external sounds is based primarily on the perceived heard sounds, but a visual aid is also used by visualizing the log-mel frequency spectrum of the signal. All the above are functionalities offered by the Sonic Visualiser software, which was used by two volunteers that are neither bee-specialists nor specially trained in sound annotation tasks.</p>\n\n<p>By marking these pairs of moments corresponding to the beginning and end of external sound periods, we are able to get the whole recording labeled into&nbsp;Bee and noBee intervals. Thus in the resulting Bee intervals only pure beehive sounds, (no external sounds) should be perceived for the entirety of the segment. The noBee intervals refer to periods where an external sound can be perceived (superimposed to the bee sounds).</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>File Structure:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Each audio file is coupled with its corresponding annotation file, identified by the same name and extension <em>.lab</em>.<br>\nFor convenience, all the annotations are collected in a single master label file named <em>beeAnnotations.mlf</em></p>\n\n<p>The <em>.lab</em>&nbsp;files consist of :&nbsp;</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>First row identifies the audio file to which the annotations refer to.</li>\n\t<li>Each line after that describes an interval with starting time point, end time point and label. The time points are expressed in seconds.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Below is an example of such an annotation file:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<pre><code>Hive3_20_07_2017_QueenBee_H3_audio_15_30_00\n0 78.45 bee\n78.46 78.95 nobee\n78.96 103.92 bee\n103.93 112.48 nobee\n112.49 152.48 bee\n.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This dataset is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.<br>\nWhen using this dataset, please cite [1]:</p>\n\n<p>[1] I.

They are focused on the improvement of their performance that can be expressed\u00a0in several ways, indeed: aerodynamic efficiency optimization, fuel consumption reduction,\u00a0COx and NOx emission reduction and so on, or targeted to overcome the classical draw-backs related to the introduction of a novel technology such as system complexity increase\u00a0and management of certification aspects. The Consortium for Research and Innovation in\u00a0Aerospace in Quebec (CRIAQ) lunched project MD0505 that can be inserted in this crow-ded frame. The target of this cooperation, involving Canadian and Italian academies and\u00a0a research centre, is the development of a camber \"morphing aileron\" integrated on an in-novative full scale wing tip of the next generation regional aircraft. This paper focuses on\u00a0the preliminary design and the numerical modeling of its architecture. The structural layout\u00a0is, at the beginning, described in detail and furthermore, a finite element (FE) model of\u00a0the entire aileron architecture is assessed and used to verify the structural integrity under\u00a0prescribed operational conditions.","doi":"10.15632/jtam-pl.55.1.307","journal":{"issue":"1","title":"Journal of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics","volume":"55"},"keywords":["morphing","actuation system","adaptive wing"],"license":{"id":"CC-BY-NC-4.0"},"publication_date":"2017-12-21","relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1120797"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1120796"}}]},"resource_type":{"subtype":"article","title":"Journal article","type":"publication"},"title":"PRELIMINARY DESIGN OF AN ADAPTIVE AILERON FOR THE NEXT\u00a0GENERATION REGIONAL AIRCRAFT"},"owners":[39432],"revision":5,"stats":{"downloads":12.0,"unique_downloads":12.0,"unique_views":6.0,"version_downloads":12.0,"version_unique_downloads":12.0,"version_unique_views":6.0,"version_views":6.0,"version_volume":17872572.0,"views":6.0,"volume":17872572.0},"updated":"2019-04-09T13:23:47.812514+00:00"}],"total":622},"links":{"next":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/?sort=bestmatch&q=%22open+design%22+%22citizen+science%22&page=4&size=200","prev":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/?sort=bestmatch&q=%22open+design%22+%22citizen+science%22&page=2&size=200","self":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/?sort=bestmatch&q=%22open+design%22+%22citizen+science%22&page=3&size=200"}}
