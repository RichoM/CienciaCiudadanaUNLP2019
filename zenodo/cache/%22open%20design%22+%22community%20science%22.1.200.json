This study aims at explaining the implication of Open Design Methodology in enhancing the sense of home in the mass housing through studying end-users\u2019 perceptions of housing physical cues. Accordingly, the collected data through a survey of housing physical cues preferences conducted on 116 Iranian students of Universiti Teknologi Malaysia living at least one year in mass housing apartments was analyzed, using Exploratory Factor Analysis and One Sample t-test. The seven extracted factors from Exploratory Factor Analysis were hierarchically classified into three levels using One Sample t-test. In addressing the aim of the study, the results of One Sample t-test shed light on end-users\u2019 perceptions, making it possible to address two different areas of decision making in mass housing namely professional and ordinary. Dealing with abstract, subjective, complicated, and multidimensional physical cues, the first area is far beyond ordinary end users knowledge, profession, and skill; hence the supervisory role of professionals is highly recommended. The second area deals with concrete and tangible physical features, which has the potential to be left open for end-users\u2019 gradually progressive decision making, and according to their evolving and emerging needs.</p>","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.807359","journal":{"issue":"3","pages":"1-18","title":"Journal of Academic and Applied Studies","volume":"6"},"keywords":["Mass Housing","Open Design

Angeles County have partnered with the La Brea Tar Pits and Museum (LBTPM) and the Invertebrate Paleontology (LACMIP) collection to create two \"citizen curation\" exercises dubbed \"Project Paleo\". Classroom kits were created with unsorted fossils from either LBPTM or from a local invertebrate paleontological field site, to be sorted and identified by local elementary and middle school students and then returned to the museum for curation, analysis, and research purposes. Each kit contains background information about the project and fossils, and an identification guide to assist the students and teachers.</p>\n  <p>The \"Project Paleo: Rancho La Brea\" kit contains three tablespoons of unsorted fossil matrix from LBTPM's Project 23. Groups of students learn about past and present food webs of the Los Angeles Basin, then sort the matrix into several categories (bones, plants, other fossils, and rocks) using a guide with drawn examples of each. An online iNaturalist (inaturalist.org) project also serves as an identification resource as well as a platform by which students can contribute photos for identification by staff researchers. This project is aimed at middle schoolers and over 700 students have used the sorting kits. Results will help to recreate past ecosystems of Southern California and help to inform a National Science Foundation (NSF) funded project, \"A Mouse's Eye View of Rancho La Brea\".</p>\n  <p>The \"Project Paleo: Marine Invertebrates of Southern California\" kit produced by LACMIP, contains approximately two cups of washed but unsorted coarse fossil matrix from a salvaged (now destroyed) construction site. This kit is aimed at 5<sup>th</sup> grade Los Angeles Unified School District classrooms and homeschooling families. Students are asked to sort fossils by species and use included identification cards to identify the sorted fossils to the best of their ability. Results of this project will be included in an NSF funded digitization project and will contribute to research on the paleoecology of Pleistocene Southern California.</p>\n  <p>Early evaluation of both kits has shown positive feedback from students and educators, as well as some room to improve instructions to students. These kits are designed to conform to Next Generation Science Standards while generating useful data for museum scientists. Collections staff are able to outsource the curation of critical data to students who get the experience of handling real museum fossils and contributing to the body of paleontological research.</p>","doi":"10.3897/biss.2.25980","imprint":{"publisher":"Pensoft Publishers"},"journal":{"issue":"","pages":"e25980","title":"Biodiversity Information Science and Standards","volume":"2"},"keywords":["microfossil","food web","paleontology","fossil","education"],"license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"publication_date":"2018-06-15","relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1296594"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1296593"}}]},"resource_type":{"subtype":"article","title":"Journal article","type":"publication"},"title":"Project Paleo: Citizen Curation and Community Science at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County"},"owners":[1161],"revision":4,"stats":{"downloads":19.0,"unique_downloads":17.0,"unique_views":5.0,"version_downloads":19.0,"version_unique_downloads":17.0,"version_unique_views":5.0,"version_views":5.0,"version_volume":913915.0,"views":5.0,"volume":913915.0},"updated":"2019-04-09T14:00:05.741682+00:00"},{"conceptdoi":"10.5281/zenodo.1328759","conceptrecid":"1328759","created":"2018-10-30T14:12:19.532747+00:00","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.1328760","files":[{"bucket":"f3cd5c3c-c2d9-4509-b2ed-026544c83fe7","checksum":"md5:7b8421f50420201351ef9a695a2f88e6","key":"619.pdf","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/f3cd5c3c-c2d9-4509-b2ed-026544c83fe7/619.pdf"},"size":675516,"type":"pdf"}],"id":1328760,"links":{"badge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.1328760.svg","bucket":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/f3cd5c3c-c2d9-4509-b2ed-026544c83fe7","conceptbadge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.1328759.svg","conceptdoi":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1328759","doi":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1328760","html":"https://zenodo.org/record/1328760","latest":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/1328760","latest_html":"https://zenodo.org/record/1328760","self":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/1328760"},"metadata":{"access_right":"open","access_right_category":"success","creators":[{"name":"M.G.A.

Despite the implementation of numerous and different models for estimating soil erosion by water in Europe, there is still a lack of harmonization of assessment methodologies.<br />\nOften, different approaches result in soil erosion rates significantly different. Even when the same model is applied to the same region the results may differ. This can be due to the way the model is implemented (i.e. with the selection of different algorithms when available) and/or to the use of datasets having different resolution or accuracy. Scientific computation is emerging as one of the central topic of the scientific method, for overcoming these problems there is thus the necessity to develop reproducible computational method where codes and data are available.<br />\nThe present study illustrates this approach. Using only public available datasets, we applied the Revised Universal Soil loss Equation (RUSLE) to locate the most sensitive areas to soil erosion by water in Europe.<br />\nA significant effort was made for selecting the better simplified equations to be used when a strict application of the RUSLE model is not possible. In particular for the computation of the Rainfall Erosivity factor (R) the reproducible research paradigm was applied. The calculation of the R factor was implemented using public datasets and the GNU R language. An easily reproducible validation procedure based on measured precipitation time series was applied using MATLAB language. Designing the computational modelling architecture with the aim to ease as much as possible the future reuse of the model in analysing climate change scenarios is also a challenging goal of the research.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nCite as:<br />\nBosco, C., de Rigo, D., Dewitte, O., Montanarella, L., 2011.<strong> Towards the reproducibility in soil erosion modeling: a new Pan-European soil erosion map.</strong> Wageningen Conference on Applied Soil Science <em>&ldquo;Soil Science in a Changing World&rdquo;</em>, 18 - 22 September 2011, Wageningen, The Netherlands.<br />\nAuthor&rsquo;s version DOI: 10.6084/m9.figshare.936872, arXiv:1402.3847<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>References</strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n[1] Rusco, E., Montanarella, L., Bosco, C., 2008. <strong>Soil erosion: a main threats to the soils in Europe</strong>.

The existing literature concentrates on practices, approaches and outcomes, with a desire to understand the implementation and the impact of these social 'design interventions'. Consequently, what is informing or may inform this practice seems less evident. This paper aims to raise awareness towards the presuppositions in design practice and research, and proposes the application of Foucauldian discourse theory to uncover and challenge any presuppositions for a more legitimate conduct. The underlying research forms part of a doctoral study that seeks to examine the role of design in society and aims to accommodate the ongoing discussions around the agency of design. The work-in-progress involves an investigation of the three parts of \\\"social design dispositive\\\" , based on J\u00e4ger and Maier's (2016) framework, to not only open up new debates in academic design research, but also to provide design practitioners a way to reflect on their work, and ultimately to inform their decision-making process by reinforcing their theoretical foundations.","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.268614","keywords":["Design for Social Innovation","Empowerment","Critical Discourse Analysis","Social Design","Transition Design"],"license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"meeting":{"dates":"Monday 21st - 22nd November 2016","place":"London, UK","title":"MEDIATIONS \u2013 Art & Design Agency and Participation in Public Space"},"publication_date":"2016-11-22","relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"268614"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"757985"}}]},"resource_type":{"subtype":"conferencepaper","title":"Conference paper","type":"publication"},"title":"In Pursuit of the Voices within Social Design Discourse"},"owners":[28266],"revision":3,"stats":{"downloads":8.0,"unique_downloads":8.0,"unique_views":5.0,"version_downloads":8.0,"version_unique_downloads":8.0,"version_unique_views":5.0,"version_views":5.0,"version_volume":9730912.0,"views":5.0,"volume":9730912.0},"updated":"2017-09-08T08:50:55.433998+00:00"},{"conceptdoi":"10.5281/zenodo.1329177","conceptrecid":"1329177","created":"2018-10-30T14:06:30.608115+00:00","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.1329178","files":[{"bucket":"1baaf53c-d234-4b60-bd25-e38887518578","checksum":"md5:02737fdaaea329b8f031225dc5fe9ba9","key":"846.pdf","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/1baaf53c-d234-4b60-bd25-e38887518578/846.pdf"},"size":1857115,"type":"pdf"}],"id":1329178,"links":{"badge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.1329178.svg","bucket":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/1baaf53c-d234-4b60-bd25-e38887518578","conceptbadge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.1329177.svg","conceptdoi":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1329177","doi":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1329178","html":"https://zenodo.org/record/1329178","latest":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/1329178","latest_html":"https://zenodo.org/record/1329178","self":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/1329178"},"metadata":{"access_right":"open","access_right_category":"success","creators":[{"name":"Y.

The current city\nplanning practice does not involve an effective land useenergy\nevaluation in its 'blueprint' urban plans. The study\nproposed an appraisal method that can be embedded in GIS\nprograms using five planning criteria as how far a planner can\ngive away from the planning principles (criteria) for the most\nenergy output s/he can obtain. The case of Balcova, a district\nin the Izmir Metropolitan area, is used conformingly for\nevaluating the proposed master plan and the geothermal\nenergy (heating only) use for the concern district.\nIf the land use design were proposed accordingly at-most\nenergy efficiency (a 30% obtained), mainly increasing the\ndensity around the geothermal wells and also proposing more\nmixed use zones, we could have 17% distortion (infidelity to\nthe main planning principles) from the original plan. The\nproposed method can be an effective tool for planners as\nsimulation media, of which calculations can be made by GIS\nready tools, to evaluate efficiency levels for different plan\nproposals, letting to know how much energy saving causes\nhow much deviation from the other planning ideals. Lower\nenergy uses can be possible for different land use proposals\nfor various policy trials.","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.1329178","journal":{"issue":"12","title":"International Journal of Architectural, Civil and Construction Sciences","volume":"2.0"},"keywords":[],"language":"eng","license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"publication_date":"2008-12-23","references":[],"related_identifiers":[{"identifier":"10.5281/zenodo.1329177","relation":"isVersionOf","scheme":"doi"}],"relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1329178"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1329177"}}]},"resource_type":{"subtype":"article","title":"Journal article","type":"publication"},"title":"Appraisal of Energy Efficiency of Urban Development Plans: The Fidelity Concept on Izmir-Balcova Case","version":"846"},"owners":[32148],"revision":2,"stats":{"downloads":4.0,"unique_downloads":3.0,"unique_views":3.0,"version_downloads":4.0,"version_unique_downloads":3.0,"version_unique_views":3.0,"version_views":3.0,"version_volume":7428460.0,"views":3.0,"volume":7428460.0},"updated":"2018-10-30T15:30:53.669161+00:00"},{"conceptdoi":"10.5281/zenodo.2596784","conceptrecid":"2596784","created":"2019-03-17T23:02:06.061616+00:00","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.2596785","files":[{"bucket":"8f519a13-d228-4763-bd71-11e917d7d8b5","checksum":"md5:f2ec7814afdddc8cd512b7e2c97a29a6","key":"160.pdf","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/8f519a13-d228-4763-bd71-11e917d7d8b5/160.pdf"},"size":524031,"type":"pdf"}],"id":2596785,"links":{"badge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.2596785.svg","bucket":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/8f519a13-d228-4763-bd71-11e917d7d8b5","conceptbadge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.2596784.svg","conceptdoi":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2596784","doi":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2596785","html":"https://zenodo.org/record/2596785","latest":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/2596785","latest_html":"https://zenodo.org/record/2596785","self":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/2596785"},"metadata":{"access_right":"open","access_right_category":"success","communities":[{"id":"de07_2010"}],"creators":[{"affiliation":"University College of West-Flanders, Ghent University","name":"De Couvreur, Lieven"},{"affiliation":"Delft University of Technology","name":"Goossens, Richard"}],"description":"<p>In this paper the authors describe a general framework for co-designing assistive devices in a horizontal user innovation network [1] by and for disabled users. This framework attempts to identify, share and use &ldquo;hidden solutions&rdquo; in rehabilitation contexts and translate them into disruptive assistive devices build with local resources. Within healthcare contexts local solutions are frequently more effective, as they reflect the physical, emotional and cognitive needs of specific patients and engage all the stakeholders in a specific local context. By using an open horizontal innovation network, where assistive devices can be easily shared and physically hacked by other paramedics, general patterns can be detected and translated into standard universal design objects. This generative design thinking approach [2] is more than feasible with digital trends like crowd sourcing, user-generated content and peer production [3]. Cheap and powerful prototyping tools have become easier to use by non-engineers; it turns them into users as well as self manufactures [4]. We discuss the different aspects of this open innovation process within a &bdquo;design for disability\" context and suggest the first steps of an iterative co- design methodology bringing together professional designers, occupational therapists and patients.

These modes of transport tend to be either relatively slow (e.g., road and water), expensive (e.g., air), or a combination of relatively slow and expensive (i.e., rail). Hyper loop is a new mode of transport that seeks to change this paradigm by being both fast and inexpensive for people and goods. Hyperloop is also unique in that it is an open design concept, similar to Linux. Feedback is desired from the community that can help advance the Hyperloop design and bring it from concept to reality. Hyperloop consists of a low pressure tube with capsules that are transported at both low and high speeds throughout the length of the tube. The capsules are supported on a cushion of air, featuring pressurized air and aerodynamic lift. The capsules are accelerated via a magnetic linear accelerator affixed at various stations on the low pressure tube with rotors contained in each capsule. Passengers may enter and exit Hyperloop at stations located either at the ends of the tube, or branches along the tube length. In this study, the initial route, preliminary design, and logistics of the Hyperloop transportation system have been derived. The system consists of capsules that travel between Los Angeles, California and San Francisco, California. The total one-way trip time is 35 minutes from county line to county line. The capsules leave on average every 2 minutes from each terminal carrying 28 people each (as often as every 30 seconds during rush hour and less frequently at night). This gives a total of 7.4 million people per tube that can be transported each year on Hyperloop. The total cost of Hyperloop is under $6 billion USD for two one-way tubes and 40 capsules.

The design procedure is developed based on the method of least squares and theory of N-coupled transmission lines. The dimensions of designed filter are about 11 mm \u00d7 11 mm and the three E-shape resonators are placed among four dielectric layers. The average insertion loss in the passband is less than 1 dB and in the stopband is about 30 dB up to 20 GHz. Its group delay in the UWB region is about 0.5 ns. The performance of the optimized filter design perfectly agrees with the microwave simulation softwares.","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.1126439","keywords":["Ultra-wideband","method of least square","multilayer microstrip filter","n-coupled transmission lines."],"language":"eng","license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"publication_date":"2016-07-03","references":["Federal Communications Commission, Revision of Part 15 of the Commission's Rules Regarding Ultra-Wideband Transmission Systems, First Report and Order, FCC 02.

To get along with time to market that is business\nreason, the section of software development for power conscious,\nbattery, devices has shifted itself from using specific low-level\nlanguages to higher level ones. Currently, complicated software\nrunning on mobile devices are often developed by high level\nlanguages those support OOP concepts. These cause the trend of\nembracing Design Patterns to mobile world.\nHowever, using Design Patterns directly in software development\nfor power conscious systems is not recommended because they were\nnot originally designed for such environment. This paper\ndemonstrates the adapted Design Pattern for power limitation system.\nBecause there are numerous original design patterns, it is not possible\nto mention the whole at once.

These criteria have to be considered at the early stage of the building design phase to meet the latest recommendations from the World Health Organization in most countries. The three design criteria are; first, establishing a radon barrier facing the ground; second, lowering the air pressure in the lower zone of the slab on ground facing downwards; third, diluting the indoor air with outdoor air. The first two criteria can prevent radon from infiltrating from the ground, and the third criteria can dilute the indoor air. By combining these three criteria, the indoor radon concentration can be lowered achieving an acceptable level. In addition, a cheap and reliable method for measuring the radon concentration in the indoor air is described. The provision on radon in the Danish Building Regulations complies with the latest recommendations from the World Health Organization. Radon can cause lung cancer and it is not known whether there is a lower limit for when it is not harmful to human beings. Therefore, it is important to reduce the radon concentration as much as possible in buildings. Airtightness is an important factor when dealing with buildings. It is important to avoid air leakages in the building envelope both facing the atmosphere, e.g. in compliance with energy requirements, but also facing the ground, to meet the requirements to ensure and control the indoor environment. Infiltration of air from the ground underneath a building is the main providing source of radon to the indoor air.","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.1112041","keywords":["Radon","natural radiation","barrier","pressure lowering","ventilation."],"language":"eng","license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"publication_date":"2016-01-01","references":["Zeeb, H., Shannoun, F.

Particle contamination is one of the major\nproblems in insulation structures, as they generate partial discharges\nleading it to major failure of insulation. Similarly corona discharges\noccur in transformer insulation. This partial discharge due to particle\nmovement / corona formation in insulation structure under different\nvoltage wave shapes, are different. In the present study, UHF\ntechnique is adopted to understand the discharge activity and could\nbe realized that the characteristics of UHF signal generated under\nlow and high fields are different. In the case of corona generated\nsignal, the frequency content of the UHF sensor output lies in the\nrange 0.3-1.2 GHz and is not much varied except for its increase in\nmagnitude of discharge with the increase in applied voltage. It is\nrealized that the current signal injected due to partial\ndischarges/corona is about 4ns duration measured for first one half\ncycle. Wavelet technique is adopted in the present study. It allows\none to identify the frequency content present in the signal at different\ninstant of time. The STD-MRA analysis helps one to identify the\nfrequency band in which the energy content of the UHF signal is\nmaximum.","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.1070581","keywords":["Contamination","Insulation","Partial Discharges","Transformer oil","UHF sensors."],"language":"eng","license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"publication_date":"2008-03-24","references":["IEEE Trial use standard general requirements and test code for oil\nimmersed HVDC converter transformers, IEEE Std C57.129-1999, IEEE\nUSA.","W.

From the\nangle of DFC, the design features of family cars were obtained, such\nas all dimensions, engine power and emission volume. At the\nconceptual design stage, cars- LCC were estimated using back\npropagation (BP) artificial neural networks (ANN) method and\ncase-based reasoning (CBR). Hamming space was used to measure the\nsimilarity among cases in CBR method. Levenberg-Marquardt (LM)\nalgorithm and genetic algorithm (GA) were used in ANN. The\ndifferences of LCC estimation model between CBR and artificial\nneural networks (ANN) were provided. ANN and CBR separately\neach method has its shortcomings. By combining ANN and CBR\nimproved results accuracy was obtained. Firstly, using ANN selected\nsome design features that affect LCC. Then using LCC estimation\nresults of ANN could raise the accuracy of LCC estimation in CBR\nmethod. Thirdly, using ANN estimate LCC errors and correct errors in\nCBR-s estimation results if the accuracy is not enough accurate.\nFinally, economically family cars and sport utility vehicle (SUV) was\ngiven as LCC estimation cases using this hybrid approach combining\nANN and CBR.","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.1081191","keywords":["case-based reasoning","life cycle cost (LCC)","artificialneural networks (ANN)","family cars"],"language":"eng","license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"publication_date":"2011-07-26","references":["Xiaochuan Chen, Jun Shao, Zhongxu Tian.

The\ndesign and analysis methodology includes simulation analysis, model\nbased testing, and in-the-loop testing. The design of conceptual driveby-\nwire, or DBW, algorithm for electronic control unit, or ECU, was\npresented to demonstrate the conceptual design process, analysis, and\nfunctionality evaluation.

However, within a new development process,\nconceptual ECU functions and parameters are needed to be evaluated.\nAs a result, the testing system was employed to support conceptual\nDBW ECU functions evaluation. For the current setup, the system\ncomponents were consisted of actual DBW ECU hardware, electric\nvehicle models, and control area network or CAN protocol. The\nvehicle models and CAN bus interface were both implemented as\nreal-time applications where ECU and CAN protocol functionality\nwere verified according to the design requirements.

It can be preferably argued that technology has enhanced the quality of life. Technology is linked both with an economic and a social structure. But there are some parts of the world or communities which are yet to reap the benefits of technological innovation. Business and organizations are now well equipped with cutting-edge innovations that improve the firm performance and provide them with a competitive edge, but rarely does it have a positive impact on any community which is weak and marginalized. In recent times, it is observed that communities are actively handling social or ecological issues with the help of indigenous technologies. Thus, &quot;Appropriate Technology&quot; comes into the discussion, which is quite prevalent in the rural third world. Appropriate technology grew as a movement in the mid-1970s during the energy crisis, but it lost its stance in the following years when people started it to describe it as an inferior technology or dead technology. Basically, there is no such technology which is inferior or sophisticated for a particular region. The relevance of appropriate technology lies in penetrating technology into a larger and weaker section of community where the &ldquo;Bottom of the pyramid&rdquo; can pay for technology if they find the price is affordable. This is a theoretical paper which primarily revolves around how appropriate technology has faded and again evolved in both developed and developing countries. The paper will try to focus on the various concepts, history and challenges faced by the appropriate technology over the years. Appropriate technology follows a documented approach but lags in overall design and diffusion. Diffusion of technology into the poorer sections of community remains unanswered until the present time. Appropriate technology is multi-disciplinary in nature; therefore, this openness allows having a varied working model for different problems. Appropriate technology is a friendly technology that seeks to improve the lives of people in a constraint environment by providing an affordable and sustainable solution. Appropriate technology needs to be defined in the era of modern technological advancement for sustainability.</p>","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.1316135","journal":{"issue":"3","title":"International Journal of Architectural, Civil and Construction Sciences","volume":"11.0"},"keywords":["Appropriate technology","community","developing country","sustainability."],"language":"eng","license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"publication_date":"2018-02-03","references":["Ahmad, A.
