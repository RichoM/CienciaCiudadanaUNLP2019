practical elements of best practice and possible improvements in science and music education. The Conductive Music program incorporates public engagement principles, open-source hardware, DIY ethos, contemporary composition techniques, and educational activities for creative and analytical thinking. These activities impart positive skills through multi-media content delivery for all learning types. The program is designed to test practices for engaging at-risk young people from urban areas in the construction and performance of new electronic instruments. The goal is to open up the world of electronic music performance to a new generation of young digital artists and to replace negative social behaviours with creative outlets for expression through technology and performance. This paper highlights the key elements designed to deliver the program's agenda and examines the ways in which these aims were realised or tested in the classroom.","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.1178921","license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"meeting":{"place":"London, United Kingdom","title":"International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression"},"part_of":{"pages":"517--520","title":"Proceedings of the International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression"},"publication_date":"2014-06-01","related_identifiers":[{"identifier":"10.5281/zenodo.1178920","relation":"isVersionOf","scheme":"doi"}],"relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1178921"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1178920"}}]},"resource_type":{"subtype":"conferencepaper","title":"Conference paper","type":"publication"},"title":"Conductive Music: Teaching Innovative Interface Design and Composition Techniques with Open-Source Hardware"},"owners":[42081],"revision":3,"stats":{"downloads":2.0,"unique_downloads":2.0,"unique_views":2.0,"version_downloads":2.0,"version_unique_downloads":2.0,"version_unique_views":2.0,"version_views":2.0,"version_volume":1264500.0,"views":2.0,"volume":1264500.0},"updated":"2018-06-28T12:03:29.539956+00:00"},{"conceptrecid":"2409295","created":"2018-12-19T05:31:59.456227+00:00","doi":"10.3897/rio.4.e31701","files":[{"bucket":"6c101f71-8eaa-4759-a384-ca579480634f","checksum":"md5:a0244c728ce0d86c86f7cda97b7c13aa","key":"RIO_article_31701.pdf","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/6c101f71-8eaa-4759-a384-ca579480634f/RIO_article_31701.pdf"},"size":62968,"type":"pdf"},{"bucket":"6c101f71-8eaa-4759-a384-ca579480634f","checksum":"md5:f3eab9ee77053d092b7505190a02ceb0","key":"RIO_article_31701.xml","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/6c101f71-8eaa-4759-a384-ca579480634f/RIO_article_31701.xml"},"size":27336,"type":"xml"}],"id":2409296,"links":{"badge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.3897/rio.4.e31701.svg","bucket":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/6c101f71-8eaa-4759-a384-ca579480634f","doi":"https://doi.org/10.3897/rio.4.e31701","html":"https://zenodo.org/record/2409296","latest":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/2409296","latest_html":"https://zenodo.org/record/2409296","self":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/2409296"},"metadata":{"access_right":"open","access_right_category":"success","creators":[{"affiliation":"School of Computing, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom|Centre for Mind/Brain Science (CIMeC), University of Trento, Trento, Italy","name":"Monachino, Simone"},{"affiliation":"International Max Planck Research School, University of T\u00fcbingen, T\u00fcbingen, Germany","name":"McDermott, Eric James"},{"affiliation":"School of Life Sciences, University of Sussex, Brighton, United Kingdom","name":"Maia Chagas, Andre"}],"description":"<p>The first edition of the Aspects of Neuroscience Brainhack took place at the Department of Physics at University of Warsaw, Poland between November 17th and 19th 2017.

These user driven modifications have allowed the re-imagining of the interface for new and novel purposes, beyond even that of the device's original intentions.

The proposed Arduilab will give full access to the experiment control unit by extending the possible test scenarios with a minimal cost.</p>","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.3277275","journal":{"pages":"19-22","title":"Analysis.

MOM combines a real-time signal processing engine implemented with Pure Data on an embedded Linux platform, with gestural interaction implemented via a variety of analog and digital sensors. Power, sound-input and sound-diffusion subsystems make the instrument autonomous and mobile. This instrument was designed in coordination with the development of an evening-length dance/music performance in which the performing musician is engaged in choreographed movements with the mobile instruments. The design methodology relied on a participatory process that engaged an interdisciplinary team made up of technologists, musicians, composers, choreographers, and dancers. The prototyping process relied on a mix of in-house and out-sourced digital fabrication processes intended to make the open source hardware and software design of the system accessible and affordable for other creators.","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.1302681","license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"meeting":{"place":"Blacksburg, Virginia, USA","title":"International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression"},"part_of":{"pages":"65--71","title":"Proceedings of the International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression"},"publication_date":"2018-06-01","related_identifiers":[{"identifier":"10.5281/zenodo.1302680","relation":"isVersionOf","scheme":"doi"}],"relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1302681"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1302680"}}]},"resource_type":{"subtype":"conferencepaper","title":"Conference paper","type":"publication"},"title":"MOM: an Extensible Platform for Rapid Prototyping and Design of Electroacoustic Instruments"},"owners":[42081],"revision":2,"stats":{"downloads":10.0,"unique_downloads":8.0,"unique_views":9.0,"version_downloads":10.0,"version_unique_downloads":8.0,"version_unique_views":9.0,"version_views":9.0,"version_volume":56310900.0,"views":9.0,"volume":56310900.0},"updated":"2018-07-01T16:53:43.158722+00:00"},{"conceptdoi":"10.5281/zenodo.2564075","conceptrecid":"2564075","created":"2019-02-13T19:56:16.909234+00:00","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.2564076","files":[{"bucket":"945faa6e-f6f9-4b66-9293-febfb2015b79","checksum":"md5:fbc2e49d3e91b38b6bc9b42ef9ffd607","key":"OSH Berlin Meetup 2019-02-06.pdf","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/945faa6e-f6f9-4b66-9293-febfb2015b79/OSH%20Berlin%20Meetup%202019-02-06.pdf"},"size":9633782,"type":"pdf"}],"id":2564076,"links":{"badge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.2564076.svg","bucket":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/945faa6e-f6f9-4b66-9293-febfb2015b79","conceptbadge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.2564075.svg","conceptdoi":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2564075","doi":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2564076","html":"https://zenodo.org/record/2564076","latest":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/2564076","latest_html":"https://zenodo.org/record/2564076","self":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/2564076"},"metadata":{"access_right":"open","access_right_category":"success","communities":[{"id":"cshl"}],"creators":[{"affiliation":"Institute for Globally Distributed Open Research and Education (IGDORE)","name":"Havemann, Johanna","orcid":"0000-0002-6157-1494"}],"description":"<p>Presentation about Open Science Hardware held at the <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/Berlin-Open-Science-Meetup/events/258563559/\">Berlin Open Science - Reproducible Research</a> - Meetup on Feb 06, 2019.</p>","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.2564076","keywords":["Open Science Hardware","Open Source Hardware"],"language":"eng","license":{"id":"CC-BY-1.0"},"publication_date":"2019-02-13","references":["Maia Chagas A (2018) Haves and have nots must find a better way: The case for open scientific hardware.

It is a fact that the distribution of information (the public knowledge) is not equal for all of us. Conventionally, this is called inequality of educational opportunity. Currently, we are living within&nbsp;the impact of such inequality, also&nbsp;with the globalization phenomenon, which has left us inside of a global crisis (the most important capitalist crisis since World War II). Nevertheless, we have&nbsp;the community forces.

Cheap smart meter design are designed not only to measure and monitoring power generation but also to enable and support new operation and control functions in power generation. In addition, this meter facilitates the user to read the energy meter even when the user is far away from the appliance. The purposed method consist of hardware and software parts. With the availability of internet access the energy data can be read quickly and easily through user&rsquo;s smartphone without using any wires to PC or remote devices. It is based on open source hardware ie ESP-12E and ACS712. This smart meter uses ACS 721 current sensor to detect the current. NodeMCU take most important data such as voltage, current, and active power so that all further calculations can be made by the center of the system. Smart meter can be used as a metering energy or as a quality meter power to provide the user with the ability to monitor the power value as well as current value. Accuracy in the readings of electric use is highly recommended to ensure electrical savings and control can be made.</p>","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.2528441","imprint":{"place":"Bangi, Malaysia"},"keywords":["Microcontroller","ACS 712","ESP-12E","Smart meter"],"language":"eng","license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"meeting":{"dates":"16 May 2018","place":"Bangi, Malaysia","title":"Hari Poster Projek Ilmiah Tahun Akhir 2018 PKE"},"part_of":{"pages":"65-68","title":"Proceedings of Undergraduate Research 2018"},"publication_date":"2018-12-28","related_identifiers":[{"identifier":"10.5281/zenodo.2528440","relation":"isVersionOf","scheme":"doi"}],"relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"2528441"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"2528440"}}]},"resource_type":{"subtype":"conferencepaper","title":"Conference paper","type":"publication"},"title":"Low Cost Smart Meter Technology Development"},"owners":[57752],"revision":3,"stats":{"downloads":24.0,"unique_downloads":21.0,"unique_views":113.0,"version_downloads":24.0,"version_unique_downloads":21.0,"version_unique_views":113.0,"version_views":124.0,"version_volume":9354168.0,"views":124.0,"volume":9354168.0},"updated":"2019-04-10T03:21:42.661090+00:00"},{"conceptdoi":"10.5281/zenodo.1217911","conceptrecid":"1217911","created":"2018-04-13T11:43:06.308201+00:00","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.1217912","files":[{"bucket":"5bb37dc6-a52a-431f-abc3-c9f65c0a912b","checksum":"md5:9ee13a53b56411ba0730c3e4ddc50338","key":"EGU2018-17461_pico_nuest_bartoschek.pdf","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/5bb37dc6-a52a-431f-abc3-c9f65c0a912b/EGU2018-17461_pico_nuest_bartoschek.pdf"},"size":2244513,"type":"pdf"}],"id":1217912,"links":{"badge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.1217912.svg","bucket":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/5bb37dc6-a52a-431f-abc3-c9f65c0a912b","conceptbadge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.1217911.svg","conceptdoi":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1217911","doi":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1217912","html":"https://zenodo.org/record/1217912","latest":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/1217912","latest_html":"https://zenodo.org/record/1217912","self":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/1217912"},"metadata":{"access_right":"open","access_right_category":"success","creators":[{"affiliation":"Institute for Geoinformatics, University of M\u00fcnster","name":"N\u00fcst, Daniel","orcid":"0000-0002-0024-5046"},{"affiliation":"Institute for Geoinformatics, University of M\u00fcnster","name":"Bartoschek, Thomas","orcid":"0000-0002-0882-1036"}],"description":"<p>Open Science is a major movement in openness, availability, and transparency spanning Open Access, Open Data, Reproducible Research, Free and Open Source Software (FOSS), and Open-source Hardware.

A highly efficient loadcell is designed and fabricated. A commercial polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) piezoelectric film is used as primary sensor for sensing small impacts. Without modifying hardware, the Arduino board is configured by programming to capture the signal from the film sensor with a resolution better than 1.1 mV. By our system, impact energy as low as 1.8 &micro;J (corresponds to impact force of 39.9 mN) is reliably and monitored. In the linear zone, sensitivity of the system found to be as high as 20.7 kV/J or 3.3 V/N with a measurement frequency of 500 Hz. The various characteristics such as linearity, hysteresis, repeatability and spectrum analysis are discussed. After calibration, measurements of unknown impact energy and impact force are investigated and results are found to agree well.</p>","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.1132064","keywords":["Arduino","impact energy","impact force","measurement system","PVDF film sensor."],"language":"eng","license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"publication_date":"2017-07-05","references":["L.

Despite the implementation of numerous and different models for estimating soil erosion by water in Europe, there is still a lack of harmonization of assessment methodologies.<br />\nOften, different approaches result in soil erosion rates significantly different. Even when the same model is applied to the same region the results may differ. This can be due to the way the model is implemented (i.e. with the selection of different algorithms when available) and/or to the use of datasets having different resolution or accuracy. Scientific computation is emerging as one of the central topic of the scientific method, for overcoming these problems there is thus the necessity to develop reproducible computational method where codes and data are available.<br />\nThe present study illustrates this approach. Using only public available datasets, we applied the Revised Universal Soil loss Equation (RUSLE) to locate the most sensitive areas to soil erosion by water in Europe.<br />\nA significant effort was made for selecting the better simplified equations to be used when a strict application of the RUSLE model is not possible. In particular for the computation of the Rainfall Erosivity factor (R) the reproducible research paradigm was applied. The calculation of the R factor was implemented using public datasets and the GNU R language. An easily reproducible validation procedure based on measured precipitation time series was applied using MATLAB language. Designing the computational modelling architecture with the aim to ease as much as possible the future reuse of the model in analysing climate change scenarios is also a challenging goal of the research.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nCite as:<br />\nBosco, C., de Rigo, D., Dewitte, O., Montanarella, L., 2011.<strong> Towards the reproducibility in soil erosion modeling: a new Pan-European soil erosion map.</strong> Wageningen Conference on Applied Soil Science <em>&ldquo;Soil Science in a Changing World&rdquo;</em>, 18 - 22 September 2011, Wageningen, The Netherlands.<br />\nAuthor&rsquo;s version DOI: 10.6084/m9.figshare.936872, arXiv:1402.3847<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>References</strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n[1] Rusco, E., Montanarella, L., Bosco, C., 2008. <strong>Soil erosion: a main threats to the soils in Europe</strong>.
