It presents an innovative approach towards the integration of biodiversity data and information systems, both from in-situ and remote sensing data sources. The aim is to address policy and information needs in a timely manner, customized for various stakeholders on different levels - from local test sites to European and international policy. The Stakeholder Roundtables are a specific task and part of a Work Package in the project (WP6) that focuses on the stakeholder engagement and the science-policy dialogue. The main aim of the Stakeholder Roundtables is to carry out regular engagement with relevant political authorities and other stakeholders at European and national level in support of the delivery of the EU BON project. Furthermore, the Roundtables seek to build up a stakeholder dialogue with exemplar sector-specific user communities to incorporate feedback loops for the products of EU BON (data, tools and models) as well as to develop improvements of existing biodiversity data workflows and to discuss sustainability issues.</p>\n\n  <p>The 4th EU BON Stakeholder Roundtable aimed to present current achievements and products of the project EU BON, which can be assigned to three categories: firstly to tools and infrastructure, secondly to the consortium and its network of collaborators and thirdly to (biodiversity) monitoring and scientific forecasting. The last Stakeholder Roundtable - in contrast to the former Roundtables which addressed European policy (Wetzel et al. 2016), citizen science and the EU BON citizen science gateway (Vohland et al. 2016, Runnel et al. 2016) and local research networks (Vohland et al. 2016b) \u2013 focused on sustainability issues of the different components of the European biodiversity observation network. The guiding question of the Roundtable was how to achieve sustainability for the products of EU BON after the project will end. It was also discussed what - among the many different products such as tools, software, scientific knowledge, models and infrastructure - are the most essential components of the project for the specific stakeholders (e.g. agencies, citizen science, researchers) and what is needed for the future (adjustments, sustainability for development, funding). One of the central questions was how the essential components could be sustained, by which institutions or networks and how they can be used in the best way for the European and national policy and research needs (e.g. monitoring, reporting) as well as for the global level (e.g. for the Group on Earth Observations, GEO). Finally, and not to forget, another essential aspect was how a European Biodiversity Network as a whole, with its different components, can be further sustained for fulfilling its goals as a central infrastructure for generating biodiversity data and information on a European scale. Here we report the outcomes and discussions of the meeting and also highlight the main messages.</p>","doi":"10.3897/rio.3.e11875","journal":{"issue":"","pages":"e11875","title":"Research Ideas and Outcomes","volume":"3"},"keywords":["sustainability","biodiversity infrastructure","EU BON","business plan","products and tools","biodiversity observation networks,"],"license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"publication_date":"2017-01-24","relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"259405"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"748172"}}]},"resource_type":{"subtype":"article","title":"Journal article","type":"publication"},"title":"4th European Biodiversity Observation Network (EU BON) Stakeholder Roundtable: Pathways to sustainability for EU BONs network of collaborators and technical infrastructure"},"owners":[22270],"revision":4,"stats":{"downloads":12.0,"unique_downloads":12.0,"unique_views":8.0,"version_downloads":12.0,"version_unique_downloads":12.0,"version_unique_views":8.0,"version_views":8.0,"version_volume":8198004.0,"views":8.0,"volume":8198004.0},"updated":"2019-04-10T04:02:01.978218+00:00"},{"conceptrecid":"997150","created":"2017-09-26T06:26:54.659339+00:00","doi":"10.11646/zootaxa.4324.1.11","id":997151,"links":{"badge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.11646/zootaxa.4324.1.11.svg","doi":"https://doi.org/10.11646/zootaxa.4324.1.11","html":"https://zenodo.org/record/997151","latest":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/997151","latest_html":"https://zenodo.org/record/997151","self":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/997151"},"metadata":{"access_right":"closed","access_right_category":"danger","alternate_identifiers":[{"identifier":"urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:50Abba40-781A-4De8-9Fae-3Fdfcfc4439B","scheme":"lsid"},{"identifier":"urn:lsid:plazi.org:pub:E106FFEFFF86170DFFD76A0D9508FF8B","scheme":"lsid"}],"creators":[{"name":"Mapstone, Gillian M."}],"description":"Mapstone, Gillian M.

Here, we review the importance of intact forest ecosystems to dead wood fungi, as well as trends in their diversity research and challenges in conservation. Saproxylic communities are sensitive to transition from virgin forests to managed ecosystems, since the latter often results in reduced tree diversity and the removal of their natural habitat dead wood. The impact of dead wood management can be quite significant since many saproxylic fungi are host-specific. The significance of citizen science and educational programmes for saproxylic mycology is discussed with the emphasis on the North American region. We intend to raise the awareness of the role that dead wood fungi play in forest health in order to support development of corresponding conservational programmes.</p>","doi":"10.3897/natureconservation.32.30875","imprint":{"publisher":"Pensoft Publishers"},"journal":{"issue":"","pages":"1-17","title":"Nature Conservation","volume":"32"},"keywords":["saproxylic fungi","dead wood","saproxylic biodiversity","coarse woody debris"],"license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"publication_date":"2019-01-07","relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"2539916"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"2539915"}}]},"resource_type":{"subtype":"article","title":"Journal article","type":"publication"},"title":"Dead wood fungi in North America: an insight into research and conservation potential"},"owners":[1161],"revision":2,"stats":{"downloads":3.0,"unique_downloads":3.0,"unique_views":1.0,"version_downloads":3.0,"version_unique_downloads":3.0,"version_unique_views":1.0,"version_views":1.0,"version_volume":22319874.0,"views":1.0,"volume":22319874.0},"updated":"2019-01-15T13:32:38.603151+00:00"},{"conceptrecid":"1419341","created":"2018-09-15T00:35:40.820091+00:00","doi":"10.13140/RG.2.2.28862.95042","files":[{"bucket":"7f928462-a3f9-4983-8faa-43119c372ceb","checksum":"md5:ab74445aad9416085d756090b68c2aec","key":"Bioethics Proposal v.Final.docx","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/7f928462-a3f9-4983-8faa-43119c372ceb/Bioethics%20Proposal%20v.Final.docx"},"size":24899,"type":"docx"}],"id":1419342,"links":{"badge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.13140/RG.2.2.28862.95042.svg","bucket":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/7f928462-a3f9-4983-8faa-43119c372ceb","doi":"https://doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.28862.95042","html":"https://zenodo.org/record/1419342","latest":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/1419342","latest_html":"https://zenodo.org/record/1419342","self":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/1419342"},"metadata":{"access_right":"open","access_right_category":"success","communities":[{"id":"citizenscience"}],"creators":[{"affiliation":"Ocean Sanctuaries","name":"Michael Bear"}],"description":"<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>How do you get citizen scientists to dive with sharks? &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Given the current level of <em>Galeophobia</em>, or fear of sharks, that&#39;s an excellent question. Most people will leave the water immediately if they think a shark is in the area.

Our experience at Ocean Sanctuaries suggests that many (but not all) divers have great respect for these apex predators and&mdash;ready for this? &mdash;Can&#39;t<em> wait </em>to dive with them.

For example, UGGC allows insights into the (re-) production of urban spaces, promising new options for pro-active urban planning, citizen participation, and local empowerment. However, the unknown quality and high volume of UGGC require advanced filtering and classification procedures to be able to extract new knowledge and actionable intelligence. The complexity of some tasks and the increasing volume of UGGC often restrict the role of citizens to data providers. We argue that citizen should and can play a decisive role in the parameterization and training of deeper computational analysis of UGGC streams. The challenge is how to present geographical analysis problems to a crowd of human supervisors, and how to elicit responses and feed those back into the workflow. We propose a hybrid processing approach, which maps geographical problems into data mining and machine-learning tasks, presents analysis results to human supervisors, and uses the responses to improve the machine-learning and data mining. For the pilot study, we adapt an approach to find semantically distinct places in UGGC. The human supervisors rate the clustering of potentially similar geo-located photographs from the platform Flickr, and thereby help parametrize both the data mining of geospatial clusters, as well as the classification of similar images based on several ancillary attributes.</p>","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.1215682","keywords":["crowdsourcing","citizen science","machine learning","data mining","user-generated geographic content","Flickr","urban places","hybrid processing"],"language":"eng","license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"publication_date":"2018-04-09","related_identifiers":[{"identifier":"10.5281/zenodo.1215681","relation":"isVersionOf","scheme":"doi"}],"relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1215682"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1215681"}}]},"resource_type":{"subtype":"preprint","title":"Preprint","type":"publication"},"title":"Towards a crowdsourced supervision of the analysis of user-generated geographic content: Engaging citizens in discovering urban places"},"owners":[42465],"revision":3,"stats":{"downloads":41.0,"unique_downloads":38.0,"unique_views":133.0,"version_downloads":41.0,"version_unique_downloads":38.0,"version_unique_views":133.0,"version_views":135.0,"version_volume":68846134.0,"views":135.0,"volume":68846134.0},"updated":"2019-04-09T13:39:04.782223+00:00"},{"conceptdoi":"10.5281/zenodo.1466868","conceptrecid":"1466868","created":"2018-10-19T10:56:30.480382+00:00","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.1466869","files":[{"bucket":"4861b3c0-7e32-4217-bb32-cf70083c5b11","checksum":"md5:820c49c973d47c9d3944872a5bc7ae6d","key":"GRECO_Full_Proposal_abc50.pdf","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/4861b3c0-7e32-4217-bb32-cf70083c5b11/GRECO_Full_Proposal_abc50.pdf"},"size":7078466,"type":"pdf"}],"id":1466869,"links":{"badge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.1466869.svg","bucket":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/4861b3c0-7e32-4217-bb32-cf70083c5b11","conceptbadge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.1466868.svg","conceptdoi":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1466868","doi":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1466869","html":"https://zenodo.org/record/1466869","latest":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/1466869","latest_html":"https://zenodo.org/record/1466869","self":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/1466869"},"metadata":{"access_right":"open","access_right_category":"success","communities":[{"id":"greco-787289"}],"contributors":[{"affiliation":"Universidad Politecnica de Madrid","name":"Carlos del Ca\u00f1izo","type":"Researcher"},{"affiliation":"Universidad Pompeu Fabra","name":"Gema Revuelta","type":"Researcher"},{"affiliation":"Universidadde Evora","name":"Luis Fialho","type":"Researcher"},{"affiliation":"Universidad Politecnica de Madrid","name":"Luis Navarte","type":"Researcher"},{"affiliation":"Fenacore","name":"David Hern\u00e1ndez","type":"Researcher"},{"affiliation":"ESCI","name":"Elmar Bartlmae","type":"Researcher"},{"affiliation":"INSOLIGHT","name":"Mathieu Ackermann","type":"Researcher"},{"affiliation":"CLSENES","name":"Nikolay Tyutyundzhiev","type":"Researcher"},{"affiliation":"Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin","name":"Eva Unger","type":"Researcher"},{"affiliation":"Reiner Lemoine Institute","name":"Berit Muller","type":"Researcher"},{"affiliation":"Universidade Sao Paulo","name":"Roberto Zilles","type":"Researcher"}],"creators":[{"affiliation":"Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Madrid","name":"Crist\u00f3bal L\u00f3pez, Ana Bel\u00e9n","orcid":"0000-0002-4314-6160"}],"description":"<p>This is the proposal approved by the European&nbsp;Commission under the call SWAFS-10-2017: Put&nbsp;Open Science into Action.

The fan material likely originates from the surface below the ice sheet, brought up via CO2 jets breaking through the seasonal ice cap. Once the dust and dirt is released into the atmosphere, the material may be blown by the surface winds into the dark streaks visible from orbit. The location, size and direction of these fans record a number of parameters important to quantifying seasonal winds and sublimation activity, the most important agent of geological change extant on Mars. We present results of a systematic mapping of these south polar seasonal fans with the Planet Four online citizen science project. Planet Four enlists the general public to map the shapes, directions, and sizes of the seasonal fans visible in orbital images. Over 80,000 volunteers have contributed to the Planet Four project, reviewing 221 images, from Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter&rsquo;s HiRISE (High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment) camera, taken in southern spring during Mars Years 29 and 30. We provide an overview of Planet Four and detail the processes of combining multiple volunteer assessments together to generate a high delity catalog of &sim; 400000 south polar seasonal fans.

In this paper, we present a system that relies on the already available Copernicus Environment Service, on Air Quality Monitoring reference stations and on a cluster of new low-cost, low-energy sensor nodes that will improve the resolution of air quality maps. The data collected by this system will be stored in a time series database, and it will be available both to city council managers for decision making and to citizens for informative purposes.

It is time-consuming and ultimately subjective. Fortunately, there are solutions to these problems in the form of citizen science projects and machine learning methods. But far more challenging is identification and classification of interacting systems. When armed only with photometry, contaminants such as field stars and unfortuitously projected galaxies often lead to misclassifications (dependence on environment). Similarly, the classifcations rely sensitively on the identification of low-surface brightness features such as tidal arms, streams, and shells (dependence on sky brightness and resolution). Simulations, on the other hand, offer foreknowledge of the stage of an interaction. Using a suite of 24 galaxy interactions covering a range of mass ratios and orbits with corresponding secular evolution runs, we train convolutional neural networks to classify galaxies into three categories: (iso) isolated; (p/i) pair/interacting; and (pm) post-merger. Our networks are trained on images with increasing levels of realism: (0) projected stellar mass maps; (1) full radiative transfer; (2) insertion into real images. We are then well-poised to answer unique questions. How important is the level of realism to the successful classification of interacting systems? How important is it to train the network with contaminating effects (inserting into real images) so that the network may adequately discriminate between bona-fide interactions and false positives? In this talk, I will discuss our answers to these questions.","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.2635339","license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"meeting":{"acronym":"","dates":"February 18-22, 2019","place":"Sydney, Australia","title":"Linking galaxies from the Epoch of initial star-formation to today.

As all crowd-based initiatives are usually built upon a core of volunteers participating to an &ldquo;open call&rdquo; to perform tasks, crowdsensing in particular relies on the willingness of participants to invest time and interest in a cause, sacrifice limited resources of their mobile devices, and provide implicit or explicit efforts, including ignoring risks that impact the privacy of their data. This document describes how incentives and rewarding schemes are adopted in this context to attract a community of users and to keep it engaged. Two incentive schemes in particular are described, both of which have been developed within the CROWD4ROADS project: a game mode that transforms collected data into generated terrain for a 2D&nbsp;platform game and a voucher exchange system that acts as a platform for any initiative for the common good. Both incentive schemes are fully anonymous and integrate within a fully anonymous data collection scheme.</p>","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.2545207","grants":[{"acronym":"CROWD4ROADS","code":"687959","funder":{"acronyms":["EC"],"doi":"10.13039/501100000780","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/funders/10.13039/501100000780"},"name":"European Commission"},"links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/grants/10.13039/501100000780::687959"},"program":"H2020","title":"CROWD sensing and ride sharing FOR ROAD Sustainability"}],"keywords":["CROWD4ROADS","crowdsourcing","crowdsensing","incentives","rewarding","smartroadsense"],"language":"eng","license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"publication_date":"2019-01-21","related_identifiers":[{"identifier":"10.5281/zenodo.2545206","relation":"isVersionOf","scheme":"doi"}],"relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"2545207"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"2545206"}}]},"resource_type":{"subtype":"report","title":"Report","type":"publication"},"title":"Incentives for Crowdsourcing"},"owners":[49537],"revision":3,"stats":{"downloads":46.0,"unique_downloads":41.0,"unique_views":60.0,"version_downloads":46.0,"version_unique_downloads":41.0,"version_unique_views":60.0,"version_views":60.0,"version_volume":9787236.0,"views":60.0,"volume":9787236.0},"updated":"2019-04-10T03:23:28.892763+00:00"},{"conceptdoi":"10.5281/zenodo.2564752","conceptrecid":"2564752","created":"2019-02-14T09:25:26.395669+00:00","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.2564753","files":[{"bucket":"52ccd9fb-2d7c-4d2d-b056-e7a1b25d0ba3","checksum":"md5:95d7064aba29aab78f086b8cadcc0bbc","key":"Final data 2017.zip","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/52ccd9fb-2d7c-4d2d-b056-e7a1b25d0ba3/Final%20data%202017.zip"},"size":12522389,"type":"zip"}],"id":2564753,"links":{"badge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.2564753.svg","bucket":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/52ccd9fb-2d7c-4d2d-b056-e7a1b25d0ba3","conceptbadge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.2564752.svg","conceptdoi":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2564752","doi":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2564753","html":"https://zenodo.org/record/2564753","latest":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/2564753","latest_html":"https://zenodo.org/record/2564753","self":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/2564753"},"metadata":{"access_right":"open","access_right_category":"success","contributors":[{"affiliation":"IDAEA-CSIC","name":"Viana, Mar","orcid":"0000-0002-4073-3802","type":"ContactPerson"}],"creators":[{"affiliation":"IDAEA-CSIC","name":"Viana, Mar","orcid":"0000-0002-4073-3802"},{"affiliation":"IDAEA-CSIC","name":"Ripoll, Anna"},{"affiliation":"UPC","name":"Barcel\u00f3-Ordinas, Jose Mar\u00eda","orcid":"0000-0002-9738-2425"},{"affiliation":"UPC","name":"Garc\u00eda Vidal, Jorge","orcid":"0000-0001-5969-1182"}],"description":"<p>Ozone concentrations in ambient air collected using low-cost sensor technologies, in the framework of EU project CAPTOR.

In many countries more than one language is in common usage. Belgium, for example, has three official languages. Crowdsourcing has helped many collections digitize their labels and generates useful data for science. Furthermore, direct engagement of the public with a herbarium increases the collection's visibility and potentially reinforces a sense of common ownership. For these reasons we built DoeDat, a multilingual crowdsourcing platform forked from Digivol of the Australian Museum (Figs 1, 2). Some of the useful features we inherited from Digivol include a georeferencing tool, configurable templates, simple project management and individual institutional branding.</p>\n  <p>Running a multilingual website does increase the work needed to setup and manage projects, but we hope to gain from the broader engagement we can attract. Currently, we are focusing our work on Belgian collections were Dutch and French are the primary languages, but in the future we may expand our languages when we work on our international collections. We also hope that we can eventually merge our code with that of Digivol, so that we can both benefit from each other's developments.</p>","doi":"10.3897/biss.2.25148","imprint":{"publisher":"Pensoft Publishers"},"journal":{"issue":"","pages":"e25148","title":"Biodiversity Information Science and Standards","volume":"2"},"keywords":["public engagement","internationalization","citizen science","herbarium","transcription","data capture"],"license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"publication_date":"2018-05-17","relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1252560"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1252559"}}]},"resource_type":{"subtype":"article","title":"Journal article","type":"publication"},"title":"A fork in the alphabet soup: DoeDat a multilingual crowdsourcing platform"},"owners":[1161],"revision":3,"stats":{"downloads":17.0,"unique_downloads":17.0,"unique_views":8.0,"version_downloads":17.0,"version_unique_downloads":17.0,"version_unique_views":8.0,"version_views":8.0,"version_volume":2969781.0,"views":8.0,"volume":2969781.0},"updated":"2019-04-09T13:46:47.602931+00:00"},{"conceptdoi":"10.5281/zenodo.1204079","conceptrecid":"1204079","created":"2018-03-20T10:01:15.761360+00:00","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.1204080","files":[{"bucket":"5a983677-4a94-403a-a9a2-4c0a40ee284f","checksum":"md5:7340355f1a50dbd9f0da3a25e803e728","key":"lake_level_Braccianosmartlake_VGI.xls","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/5a983677-4a94-403a-a9a2-4c0a40ee284f/lake_level_Braccianosmartlake_VGI.xls"},"size":38912,"type":"xls"}],"id":1204080,"links":{"badge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.1204080.svg","bucket":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/5a983677-4a94-403a-a9a2-4c0a40ee284f","conceptbadge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.1204079.svg","conceptdoi":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1204079","doi":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1204080","html":"https://zenodo.org/record/1204080","latest":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/1204080","latest_html":"https://zenodo.org/record/1204080","self":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/1204080"},"metadata":{"access_right":"open","access_right_category":"success","creators":[{"affiliation":"Lifeguard  Bracciano","name":"Behfar, Armin"},{"affiliation":"feguard, Bracciano Crocicchi, Marco, Parco Regionale Naturale Lago di Bracciano, Italy","name":"Crocicchi, Marco"},{"affiliation":"Citizen Scientist","name":"Loreto, Tommaso"},{"affiliation":"Geologist ,Bracciano Smart Lake","name":"Mecali, Alessandro"},{"affiliation":"Centro Surf Bracciano,Bracciano RM Italy","name":"Notino, Simone"},{"affiliation":"journalist Bracciano Smart Lake","name":"Perugini,Emanuele"},{"affiliation":"IRSA CNR","name":"Rossi, David"},{"affiliation":"Citizen Scientist","name":"Sulla, Antonio"}],"description":"<p>This VGI dataset contains the daily level data ( in meters&nbsp; on sea level during the period 06-03-2015 to 19-03-2018)&nbsp; directly observed on the idrometers available at three locations ( Molo degli Inglesi , Molo of Anguillara, Molo of Trevignano)&nbsp; in&nbsp; Bracciano&#39;s lake, Latium ,Italy and freely availables at website https://braccianosmartlake.com/rilevamento-quota-lago/.</p>\n\n<p>In the datafile, given in excel format, a cubic spline interpolation are computed on the raw data in order to give a daily continuos profile of lake&#39;s level.</p>\n\n<p>A referenced daily mean level obtained from ACEA data are also provided for 1995-2017 in the dataset file.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.1204080","keywords":["lake , bracciano , level of water, citizen scienze"],"language":"eng","license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"notes":"Bracciano Smartlake is a citizen science initiative supported by a scientific council.

The products and platform will provide the robust data to support decision making on biodiversity conservation, fundamental research on biodiversity evolution and spatial patterns,\u00a0and\u00a0species identification for citizen science. China flora online will include 35,000 species of higher plants in China and an online editing environment for botanists to maintain the floral records. The trait database will include structured data of animals, plants and fungi, such as weight, height, length, color and shape of organisms. This species catalogue will be the\u00a0annually\u00a0updated version of the Catalogue of Life, China. The distribution maps will show the spatial pattern for each species of vertebrate animal and higher plant.

accumulation of alien species (AS) introductions worldwide, additionally the rate of spread for some species has also been shown to be increasing. However, the challenges of gathering information on AS are recognized. Recent developments in citizen science (CS) provide an opportunity to improve data flow and knowledge on AS while ensuring effective and high quality societal engagement with the issue of IAS (Invasive Alien Species). Advances in technology, particularly on-line recording and smartphone apps, along with the development of social media, have revolutionized CS and increased connectivity while new and innovative analysis techniques are emerging to ensure appropriate management, visualization, interpretation and use and sharing of the data. In early July 2018 we launched a European CO-operation in Science and Technology (COST) Action to address multidisciplinary research questions in relation to developing and implementing CS, advancing scientific understanding of AS dynamics while informing decision-making specifically implementation of technical requirements of relevant legislation such as the EU Regulation 1143/2014 on IAS. It will also support the EU biodiversity goals and embedding science within society. The Action will explore and document approaches to establishing a European-wide CS AS network. It will embrace relevant innovations for data gathering and reporting to support the implementation of monitoring and surveillance measures, while ensuring benefits for society and citizens, through an AS CS European network. The Action will, therefore, increase levels of participation and quality of engagement with current CS initiatives, ensuring and evaluating educational value, and improve the value outcomes for potential users including citizens, scientists, alien species managers, policy-makers, local authorities, industry and other stakeholders.</p>","doi":"10.3897/rio.4.e31412","imprint":{"publisher":"Pensoft Publishers"},"journal":{"issue":"","pages":"e31412","title":"Research Ideas and Outcomes","volume":"4"},"keywords":["public participation in science","invasive species","monitoring","public awareness","visualisation","communication","conservation"],"license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"publication_date":"2018-11-07","relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1488451"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1488450"}}]},"resource_type":{"subtype":"article","title":"Journal article","type":"publication"},"title":"Increasing understanding of alien species through citizen science (Alien-CSI)"},"owners":[1161],"revision":3,"stats":{"downloads":18.0,"unique_downloads":18.0,"unique_views":8.0,"version_downloads":18.0,"version_unique_downloads":18.0,"version_unique_views":8.0,"version_views":8.0,"version_volume":13773060.0,"views":8.0,"volume":13773060.0},"updated":"2019-04-09T14:25:27.406599+00:00"},{"conceptrecid":"995404","created":"2017-09-24T06:58:51.595537+00:00","doi":"10.3897/phytokeys.85.14925.figure4","files":[{"bucket":"09ad2385-9eed-4595-bdff-4f8615738b8e","checksum":"md5:0469d7f07dc5ff8fe1bdc79a2106bba4","key":"big_149259.jpg","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/09ad2385-9eed-4595-bdff-4f8615738b8e/big_149259.jpg"},"size":284438,"type":"jpg"}],"id":995405,"links":{"badge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.3897/phytokeys.85.14925.figure4.svg","bucket":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/09ad2385-9eed-4595-bdff-4f8615738b8e","doi":"https://doi.org/10.3897/phytokeys.85.14925.figure4","html":"https://zenodo.org/record/995405","latest":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/995405","latest_html":"https://zenodo.org/record/995405","self":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/995405","thumb250":"https://zenodo.org/api/iiif/v2/09ad2385-9eed-4595-bdff-4f8615738b8e:badecab4-eebc-47e3-9b06-c410d535eeaf:big_149259.jpg/full/250,/0/default.jpg"},"metadata":{"access_right":"open","access_right_category":"success","communities":[{"id":"biosyslit"}],"creators":[{"affiliation":"Natuurpunt Studie, Coxiestraat 11, 2800 Mechelen, Belgium","name":"Steeman, Roosmarijn"},{"affiliation":"Natuurpunt Studie, Coxiestraat 11, 2800 Mechelen, Belgium","name":"Vanreusel, Wouter"},{"affiliation":"Plantenwerkgroep Genk, 3600 Genk, Belgium","name":"Barendse, Rutger"},{"affiliation":"Botanic Garden of Meise, Nieuwelaan 38, 1860 Meise, Belgium","name":"Verloove, Filip"},{"affiliation":"Natuurpunt, Coxiestraat 11, 2800 Mechelen, Belgium","name":"Wysmantel, Nico"},{"affiliation":"Natuurpunt, Coxiestraat 11, 2800 Mechelen, Belgium","name":"Van den Bussche, Walter"},{"affiliation":"Natuurpunt, Coxiestraat 11, 2800 Mechelen, Belgium","name":"Gyselinck, Thomas"},{"affiliation":"Natuurpunt Beheer, Coxiestraat 11, 2800 Mechelen, Belgium","name":"Hendrickx, Pieter"},{"affiliation":"WVI, Baron Ruzettelaan 35, 8310 Brugge, Belgium","name":"Zwaenepoel, Arnout"},{"affiliation":"Natuurpunt, Coxiestraat 11, 2800 Mechelen, Belgium","name":"Van Vooren, Pierre"},{"affiliation":"University of Antwerp, Wilrijk, Belgium","name":"Jacobs, Steven"},{"affiliation":"Research Institute for Nature and Forest (INBO), Kliniekstraat 25, 1070 Brussels, Belgium","name":"Desmet, Peter"},{"affiliation":"Natuurpunt Studie, Coxiestraat 11, 2800 Mechelen, Belgium","name":"Gielen, Karin"},{"affiliation":"Natuurpunt Studie, Coxiestraat 11, 2800 Mechelen, Belgium","name":"Herremans, Marc"},{"affiliation":"Evolutionary Ecology Group, University of Antwerp, Universiteitsplein 1, 2610 Wilrijk, Belgium","name":"Swinnen, Kristijn R.R."}],"description":"Figure 4 - \n          Left: the number of plant observations per IFBL grid cell.

Since 2015, they organized &ldquo;Cammini LTER&rdquo;, trails connecting a number of LTER-Italy sites, where researchers walked and cycled with citizens, sharing research questions, methodologies and results. The citizens&rsquo; engagement through a physical and visible movement of researchers outside their laboratories enhanced the opportunity to familiarize with a wide variety of Italian ecosystems and with the LTER data acquisition procedures. The slow rhythm of walking or cycling offers the possibility to overcome an exclusively rational and cognitive approach, breaking down the barriers between science and society, and bringing emotions and affectivity into the ecological subjects.

Finally, the last section 10 ideas to include the RRI perspective in STEM Education offers a useful guide of ten big ideas about how RRI perspective could be brought to STEM Education, considering the pillars and processes that characterize the RRI paradigm and linking these big ideas with the several methodologies in STEM education.</p>","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.1303805","grants":[{"acronym":"STEM4youth","code":"710577","funder":{"acronyms":["EC"],"doi":"10.13039/501100000780","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/funders/10.13039/501100000780"},"name":"European Commission"},"links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/grants/10.13039/501100000780::710577"},"program":"H2020","title":"Promotion of STEM education by key scientific challenges and their impact on our life and career perspectives"}],"keywords":["RRI, stem education, citizen science, R&I, learning"],"language":"eng","license":{"id":"CC-BY-SA-4.0"},"publication_date":"2018-07-03","related_identifiers":[{"identifier":"10.5281/zenodo.1303804","relation":"isVersionOf","scheme":"doi"}],"relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1303805"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1303804"}}]},"resource_type":{"subtype":"report","title":"Report","type":"publication"},"title":"10 ideas to include the RRI perspective in STEM education"},"owners":[40107],"revision":2,"stats":{"downloads":67.0,"unique_downloads":63.0,"unique_views":74.0,"version_downloads":67.0,"version_unique_downloads":63.0,"version_unique_views":74.0,"version_views":78.0,"version_volume":144538028.0,"views":78.0,"volume":144538028.0},"updated":"2018-07-03T08:53:46.909143+00:00"},{"conceptdoi":"10.5281/zenodo.1438459","conceptrecid":"1438459","created":"2018-09-28T17:24:50.803986+00:00","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.1438460","files":[{"bucket":"b11b44eb-9096-482e-951d-d9675738d020","checksum":"md5:af2361a64d98f36b72662e677698ebf3","key":"GROOM_S1.5_GFBio Paper 53.pdf","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/b11b44eb-9096-482e-951d-d9675738d020/GROOM_S1.5_GFBio%20Paper%2053.pdf"},"size":2410545,"type":"pdf"}],"id":1438460,"links":{"badge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.1438460.svg","bucket":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/b11b44eb-9096-482e-951d-d9675738d020","conceptbadge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.1438459.svg","conceptdoi":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1438459","doi":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1438460","html":"https://zenodo.org/record/1438460","latest":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/1438460","latest_html":"https://zenodo.org/record/1438460","self":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/1438460"},"metadata":{"access_right":"open","access_right_category":"success","creators":[{"affiliation":"Meise Botanic Garden","name":"Groom, Quentin","orcid":"0000-0002-0596-5376"},{"affiliation":"Belgian Biodiversity Platform","name":"Vanderhoeven, Sonia","orcid":"0000-0002-6298-5373"},{"affiliation":"INBO (Research Institure for Nature and Forest)","name":"Reyserhove, Lien","orcid":"0000-0001-7484-9267"},{"affiliation":"INBO (Research Institure for Nature and Forest)","name":"Oldoni, Damiano","orcid":"0000-0003-3445-7562"},{"affiliation":"INBO (Research Institure for Nature and Forest)","name":"Adriaens, Tim","orcid":"0000-0001-7268-4200"},{"affiliation":"INBO (Research Institure for Nature and Forest)","name":"Desmet, Peter","orcid":"0000-0002-8442-8025"}],"description":"<p>A presentation on the TrIAS project&nbsp;to the International Conference on Ecological Informatics 2018, held in Jena, Germany. 24-28 September 2018.</p>\n\n<p>Details on the TrIAS project can be found here...</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Groom, Q.

In the field of biology, new species and new interspecies associations are constantly discovered by making use of museum collections, digitalised materials or citizen science programs. In our study, the Myrmica Latreille, 1804 image collection of AntWeb.org was screened for fungal ectoparasites. A total of 397 imaged specimens from 133 species were visually investigated. A single specimen of M. hellenica Finzi, 1926, collected in Greece by U. Sahlberg, showed a conspicuous fungal infection. The parasite was identified using microscopic methods as Rickia wasmannii Cavara, an ectoparasitic fungal species specialised to Myrmica ants. This finding represents a new country record and a new Myrmica species for the host spectrum of R. wasmannii. According to our results, online entomological databases can be screened relatively easily for ectoparasitic fungal infections from new hosts and new regions. However, depending on quality of the insect voucher photos, additional investigation of the material could be needed to confirm the identity of the parasite.</p>","doi":"10.3897/jhr.61.20255","imprint":{"publisher":"Pensoft Publishers"},"journal":{"issue":"","pages":"85-94","title":"Journal of Hymenoptera Research","volume":"61"},"keywords":["Fungi","Ascomycota","Laboulbeniomycetes","Laboulbeniales","Laboulbeniaceae","Rickia","Rickia wasmannii","Biological collections","database","Myrmica hellenica","distribution","Greece"],"license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"publication_date":"2017-12-20","relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1138954"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1138953"}}]},"resource_type":{"subtype":"article","title":"Journal article","type":"publication"},"title":"Online image databases as multi-purpose resources: discovery of a new host ant of Rickia wasmannii Cavara (Ascomycota, Laboulbeniales) by screening AntWeb.org"},"owners":[1161],"revision":4,"stats":{"downloads":17.0,"unique_downloads":15.0,"unique_views":4.0,"version_downloads":17.0,"version_unique_downloads":15.0,"version_unique_views":4.0,"version_views":4.0,"version_volume":23104902.0,"views":4.0,"volume":23104902.0},"updated":"2019-04-09T13:26:19.420970+00:00"},{"conceptrecid":"2641434","created":"2019-04-16T04:30:07.072744+00:00","doi":"10.3897/zookeys.836.29252","files":[{"bucket":"37fa270f-0037-4fb8-ad0e-224c08f26164","checksum":"md5:659cfc925e03c19305bc9d877f18b1e2","key":"29252_PDF_1_189421_LE_292273.pdf","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/37fa270f-0037-4fb8-ad0e-224c08f26164/29252_PDF_1_189421_LE_292273.pdf"},"size":1333358,"type":"pdf"},{"bucket":"37fa270f-0037-4fb8-ad0e-224c08f26164","checksum":"md5:2d6dd989abd113ff107650b9db169ba5","key":"ZK_article_29252.xml","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/37fa270f-0037-4fb8-ad0e-224c08f26164/ZK_article_29252.xml"},"size":169433,"type":"xml"}],"id":2641435,"links":{"badge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.3897/zookeys.836.29252.svg","bucket":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/37fa270f-0037-4fb8-ad0e-224c08f26164","doi":"https://doi.org/10.3897/zookeys.836.29252","html":"https://zenodo.org/record/2641435","latest":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/2641435","latest_html":"https://zenodo.org/record/2641435","self":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/2641435"},"metadata":{"access_right":"open","access_right_category":"success","communities":[{"id":"biosyslit"}],"creators":[{"affiliation":"BRC Foundation, Bennekom, Netherlands","name":"Wehrmann, Jasper"},{"affiliation":"BRC Foundation, Bennekom, Netherlands|Zostera B.V., Boskoop, Netherlands","name":"de Boer, Folkert"},{"affiliation":"BRC Foundation, Bennekom, Netherlands","name":"Benjumea, Rafa"},{"affiliation":"BRC Foundation, Bennekom, Netherlands","name":"Cavaill\u00e8s, Simon"},{"affiliation":"BRC Foundation, Bennekom, Netherlands","name":"Engelen, Dries"},{"affiliation":"BRC Foundation, Bennekom, Netherlands","name":"Jansen, Johannes"},{"affiliation":"BirdLife Europe and Central Asia, Brussels, Belgium","name":"Verhelst, Brecht"},{"affiliation":"BRC Foundation, Bennekom, Netherlands|University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands","name":"Vansteelant, Wouter M.G."}],"description":"<p>One of the most important geographical bottlenecks for migrating raptors in the east African-Palearctic migration system is situated between the easternmost tip of the Black Sea and the Lesser Caucasus, just north of Batumi, in the Republic of Georgia.

To date much of this work has focused on plants, but animal specimens are also useful in this regard. In particular, bird specimens may include data on age, gonad size and development, and molt, all of which are relevant to estimating breeding phenology. In addition, bird collections include nests and eggs, which are direct records of breeding. These data are some of the richest available for any vertebrate group, and the potential for integration with citizen-science-based data (e.g. eBird) is extremely promising. However, there are a number of challenges associated with use of these data, including biased geographic sampling, incomplete digitization, and non-uniform data standards, that currently limit their utility. In addition, methods for analysis of these data have not been well developed. Here, we outline informatics challenges associated with developing a database of avian gonad size data. In addition, we present a novel analytical framework for estimating phenology from such data (Fig. 1) that is broadly applicable to seasonal phenotype measurements.</p>","doi":"10.3897/tdwgproceedings.1.20324","imprint":{"publisher":"Pensoft Publishers"},"journal":{"issue":"","pages":"e20324","title":"Biodiversity Information Science and Standards","volume":"1"},"keywords":["phenology","birds","gonad","periodic regression"],"license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"publication_date":"2017-08-15","relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1140571"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1140570"}}]},"resource_type":{"subtype":"article","title":"Journal article","type":"publication"},"title":"The use of avian museum specimen data in phenology studies: prospects and challenges"},"owners":[1161],"revision":4,"stats":{"downloads":18.0,"unique_downloads":16.0,"unique_views":6.0,"version_downloads":18.0,"version_unique_downloads":16.0,"version_unique_views":6.0,"version_views":6.0,"version_volume":1564502.0,"views":6.0,"volume":1564502.0},"updated":"2019-04-09T13:26:53.551791+00:00"},{"conceptdoi":"10.5281/zenodo.2254311","conceptrecid":"2254311","created":"2018-12-13T20:28:44.905883+00:00","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.2254312","files":[{"bucket":"977731ab-8f73-4b45-8946-e9cd81e3bc16","checksum":"md5:4858547aee6b4d656167e9b33f4d1baa","key":"Laine Heidi_Open Science in RI CoCs.pdf","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/977731ab-8f73-4b45-8946-e9cd81e3bc16/Laine%20Heidi_Open%20Science%20in%20RI%20CoCs.pdf"},"size":468248,"type":"pdf"}],"id":2254312,"links":{"badge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.2254312.svg","bucket":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/977731ab-8f73-4b45-8946-e9cd81e3bc16","conceptbadge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.2254311.svg","conceptdoi":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2254311","doi":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2254312","html":"https://zenodo.org/record/2254312","latest":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/2254312","latest_html":"https://zenodo.org/record/2254312","self":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/2254312"},"metadata":{"access_right":"open","access_right_category":"success","creators":[{"affiliation":"University of Helsinki","name":"Laine, Heidi","orcid":"0000-0002-6658-0664"}],"description":"<p>Abstract</p>\n\n<p>The purpose of this article is to examine the conceptual alignment between the ethical principles of research integrity and open science. Research integrity is represented in this study by four general codes of conduct on responsible conduct of research (RCR), three of them international in scope, and one national. A representative list of ethical principles associated with open science is compiled in order to create categories for assessing the content of the codes. According to the analysis, the current understanding of RCR is too focused on traditional publications and the so called FFP definition of research misconduct to fully support open science. The main gaps include recognising citizen science and societal outreach and supporting open collaboration both among the research community and beyond its traditional borders. Updates for both the content of CoCs as well as the processes of creating such guidelines are suggested.</p>","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.2254312","journal":{"issue":"4/2018","title":"Informaatiotutkimus"},"keywords":["open science","open scholarship","research ethics","research integrity","science studies","code of conduct","research community","self-regulation"],"language":"eng","license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"notes":"Research funded by Tiina and Antti Herlin Foundation","publication_date":"2018-12-13","related_identifiers":[{"identifier":"10.5281/zenodo.2254311","relation":"isVersionOf","scheme":"doi"}],"relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"2254312"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"2254311"}}]},"resource_type":{"subtype":"preprint","title":"Preprint","type":"publication"},"title":"Open Science and Codes of Conduct on Research Integrity"},"owners":[20514],"revision":14,"stats":{"downloads":21.0,"unique_downloads":20.0,"unique_views":13.0,"version_downloads":21.0,"version_unique_downloads":20.0,"version_unique_views":13.0,"version_views":14.0,"version_volume":9833208.0,"views":14.0,"volume":9833208.0},"updated":"2019-04-10T02:06:50.131511+00:00"},{"conceptrecid":"1445718","created":"2018-10-04T16:17:57.649628+00:00","doi":"10.3390/app8101743","files":[{"bucket":"03214915-b11a-43b2-97bc-270957535c84","checksum":"md5:6044ecb184f24e485618b9dbe44954a0","key":"applsci-08-01743.pdf","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/03214915-b11a-43b2-97bc-270957535c84/applsci-08-01743.pdf"},"size":2484713,"type":"pdf"}],"id":1445719,"links":{"badge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.3390/app8101743.svg","bucket":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/03214915-b11a-43b2-97bc-270957535c84","doi":"https://doi.org/10.3390/app8101743","html":"https://zenodo.org/record/1445719","latest":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/1445719","latest_html":"https://zenodo.org/record/1445719","self":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/1445719"},"metadata":{"access_right":"open","access_right_category":"success","communities":[{"id":"fp7-bmc"}],"creators":[{"affiliation":"CNR-ISTI","name":"Martinelli, Massimo","orcid":"0000-0001-7419-5099"},{"affiliation":"CNR-ISTI","name":"Moroni, Davide","orcid":"0000-0002-5175-5126"}],"description":"<p>The ability to detect and monitor oil spills at sea is becoming increasingly important due to the high demand of oil-based products. Remote sensing frameworks have been proven to give accurate results in case of major events; nonetheless, also medium and micro oil spills have their own importance, especially in protected areas that deserve special attention. In this paper, we propose a monitoring framework based on the collection of in situ observations and on their integration with remote sensing in order to fill out existing observational gaps. In particular, besides the data collected by special monitoring devices, in situ observations include volunteered geographical information as an additional source of valuable data. Oil spill sights, notified by volunteers through a specially-designed app, are integrated in the monitoring system and therein processed together with remote sensing data in order to proactively detect anomalous events and produce alerts.

It will do this by implementing a generative research cycle involving networking, dialogue, participatory research and interpretation phases centered around and driven by children and young people, out of which a diverse range of outputs, critical perspectives and other insights will emerge to inform policy and decision-making in relation to children and young people&rsquo;s needs in relation to digital society. The WYRED Platform is already developed, but the target group, young people, should accept it to ensure project aims.

However, potential applications of machine learning methods in biodiversity research are often limited by the relative scarcity of data suitable for training machine learning models. Development of high-quality training data sets can be a surprisingly challenging task that can easily consume hundreds of person-hours of time. In this talk, we present the results of our recent work implementing and comparing several different methods for generating annotated, biodiversity-oriented image data for training machine learning models, including collaborative expert scoring, local volunteer image annotators with on-site training, and distributed, remote image annotation via citizen science platforms. We discuss error rates, among-annotator variance, and depth of coverage required to ensure highly reliable image annotations.  We also discuss time considerations and efficiency of the various methods. Finally, we present new software, called ImageAnt (currently under development), that supports efficient, highly flexible image annotation workflows. ImageAnt was created primarily in response to the challenges we discovered in our own efforts to generate image-based training data for machine learning models. ImageAnt features a simple user interface and can be used to implement sophisticated, adaptive scripting of image annotation tasks.</p>","doi":"10.3897/biss.3.37615","imprint":{"publisher":"Pensoft Publishers"},"journal":{"issue":"","pages":"e37615","title":"Biodiversity Information Science and Standards","volume":"3"},"keywords":["machine learning","computer vision","image labeling"],"license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"publication_date":"2019-07-02","relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"3289056"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"3289055"}}]},"resource_type":{"subtype":"article","title":"Journal article","type":"publication"},"title":"Methods, New Software Tools, and Best Practices for Developing High-quality Training Data for Machine Learning-based Image Analysis in Biodiversity Research"},"owners":[1161],"revision":2,"stats":{"downloads":3.0,"unique_downloads":3.0,"unique_views":3.0,"version_downloads":3.0,"version_unique_downloads":3.0,"version_unique_views":3.0,"version_views":3.0,"version_volume":176877.0,"views":3.0,"volume":176877.0},"updated":"2019-07-10T07:05:57.610036+00:00"},{"conceptdoi":"10.5281/zenodo.1482872","conceptrecid":"1482872","created":"2018-11-11T14:36:37.395311+00:00","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.1482873","files":[{"bucket":"6093326a-e49c-46f4-b9f5-f0dd49c9c189","checksum":"md5:a4e12d62f6b4d567f6f2672bf46b5fca","key":"MicroDraw_OHBM2015.pdf","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/6093326a-e49c-46f4-b9f5-f0dd49c9c189/MicroDraw_OHBM2015.pdf"},"size":3475578,"type":"pdf"}],"id":1482873,"links":{"badge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.1482873.svg","bucket":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/6093326a-e49c-46f4-b9f5-f0dd49c9c189","conceptbadge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.1482872.svg","conceptdoi":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1482872","doi":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1482873","html":"https://zenodo.org/record/1482873","latest":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/1482873","latest_html":"https://zenodo.org/record/1482873","self":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/1482873"},"metadata":{"access_right":"open","access_right_category":"success","creators":[{"affiliation":"Institut Pasteur","name":"Toro, Roberto","orcid":"0000-0002-6671-858X"},{"affiliation":"Max Planck Institute  for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences","name":"Katja Heuer","orcid":"0000-0002-7237-0196"}],"description":"<p>An A0 poster which is designed for fabric print and can be&nbsp;cut and sewed into a bag.</p>\n\n<p>The poster was presented at the 2015 Annual Meeting of the Organization for Human Brain Mapping (OHBM) in Hawaii, 14&ndash;18 June.</p>\n\n<p>MicroDraw is a web application by&nbsp;<a href=\"http://neuroanatomy.github.io/\">NAAT</a>&nbsp;to visualise and collaboratively annotate high resolution histology data.

These include species information\u00a0Fig. 1 (e.g. descriptions, photos\u00a0and administrative attributes); citizen science platforms enabling recording, managing and sharing of observation data; an e-learning environment for species identification; management and sharing of restricted data among authorities; building a national DNA barcode reference library and linking it to species occurrence data; community-driven species identification support; large-scale and multi-technology digitisation of natural history collections; and IUCN Red Listing\u00a0to conduct a periodic national assesment of the status of the threatened species.</p>\n  <p>To improve the taxonomic coverage and the content of species information, FinBIF is starting a process to collaborate with the species information community at large, in order to collate already existing but not yet openly distributed information.

Scientific and technical challenges need to be met for building global EBV data products even for the most &ldquo;classic&rdquo; EBVs with which biodiversity experts (in particular, conservation biologists) are traditionally familiarized, such as &lsquo;species distribution&rsquo; or &lsquo;population abundance&rsquo;. These challenges imply, e.g. the need (i) to develop tools and models for combining heterogeneous, multi-source datasets and filling data gaps in geographic, temporal and taxonomic coverage; (ii) to integrate new methods and technologies for data collection such as sensor networks, DNA-based techniques, and satellite remote sensing; (iii) to solve major technical issues related to data product structure, data storage, execution of workflows, and the production process/cycle as well as approaching technical interoperability among research infrastructures, or (v) to achieve semantic interoperability by adopting standards and tools for capturing consistent metadata. Since all EBVs are produced from heterogeneous types of data, such as those provided by natural history collections, national and international monitoring programs, research surveys, or citizen science initiatives, from the law &amp; policy perspective the challenges include mainly three sets of problems:</p>\n\n<p>(1) providing frameworks for making scientific and technically sound authoritative decisions for the building of EBV products;</p>\n\n<p>(2) ensuring legal interoperability by endorsing open data or data that are free from restrictions on access, use, modification, and sharing; and</p>\n\n<p>(3) providing a framework for making authoritative decisions on minimum requirements of data policies attached to the data used in EBV products and the products themselves along the workflows embedded in the continuum of the EBV production processes since a) individual researchers and teams act as if data were proprietary, and the use of data is not necessarily designated as open; b) there is a high possibility that EBV products may have to be built using data from providers with incompatible data policies (e.g. using of different datasets for the same species from providers with different data policies) even if intended to be open and non proprietary; and c) the mere existence of data, datasets and other derivative products is built on practices of Big Data management techniques (e.g. citizen science) that may create other conditions or legal limitations to their use and re-use.</p>\n\n<p>This paper addresses these three different law &amp; policy issues in order to elaborate a set of recommendations for all actors, from individual scientists to institutions involved in the provision of raw data to the EBVs products all along the continuum between primary data observations (&lsquo;raw data&rsquo;) and synthetic or derived indices (&lsquo;indicators&rsquo;) to final products development for EBVs calculations.</p>","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.1323495","grants":[{"acronym":"GLOBIS-B","code":"654003","funder":{"acronyms":["EC"],"doi":"10.13039/501100000780","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/funders/10.13039/501100000780"},"name":"European Commission"},"links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/grants/10.13039/501100000780::654003"},"program":"H2020","title":"GLOBal Infrastructures for Supporting Biodiversity research"}],"keywords":["Biodiversity informatics","Research infrastructures","Essential Biodiversity Variables","Biodiversity and Ecosystems data","Workflow development","Legal interoperability","Aichi targets"],"language":"eng","license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"publication_date":"2018-01-05","related_identifiers":[{"identifier":"10.5281/zenodo.1323494","relation":"isVersionOf","scheme":"doi"}],"relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1323495"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1323494"}}]},"resource_type":{"subtype":"report","title":"Report","type":"publication"},"title":"GLOBIS-B Position Paper for Policymakers on the Potential Solutions to Scientific, Technical and Legal Interoperability Issues"},"owners":[6733],"revision":3,"stats":{"downloads":12.0,"unique_downloads":10.0,"unique_views":8.0,"version_downloads":12.0,"version_unique_downloads":10.0,"version_unique_views":8.0,"version_views":8.0,"version_volume":19546224.0,"views":8.0,"volume":19546224.0},"updated":"2018-08-04T20:25:42.510780+00:00"},{"conceptrecid":"818629","created":"2017-06-26T12:28:03.187615+00:00","doi":"10.1038/srep43890","files":[{"bucket":"20690a2f-7fe9-46e4-95d9-bc67a5f266e2","checksum":"md5:39ee4c2cccc32c5ca88eeb912bfd4ca5","key":"Weyhenmeyer_Nature_17.pdf","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/20690a2f-7fe9-46e4-95d9-bc67a5f266e2/Weyhenmeyer_Nature_17.pdf"},"size":860793,"type":"pdf"}],"id":818630,"links":{"badge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.1038/srep43890.svg","bucket":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/20690a2f-7fe9-46e4-95d9-bc67a5f266e2","doi":"https://doi.org/10.1038/srep43890","html":"https://zenodo.org/record/818630","latest":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/818630","latest_html":"https://zenodo.org/record/818630","self":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/818630"},"metadata":{"access_right":"open","access_right_category":"success","communities":[{"id":"c-cascades"}],"creators":[{"affiliation":"Department of Ecology and Genetics/Limnology, Uppsala University, Norbyv\u00e4gen 18D, 752 36 Uppsala, Sweden","name":"Weyhenmeyer, Gesa A."},{"affiliation":"Science and Technology Branch, Environment and Climate Change Canada, 4905 Dufferin Str.

The students found mostly negative Tw-Ta across small ponds, lakes, streams/rivers and the sea shore (i.e. downward QH), with Tw-Ta becoming increasingly negative with increasing Ta. Further examination of Tw-Ta using high-frequency temperature data from inland waters across the globe confirmed that Tw-Ta is linearly related to Ta. Using the longest available high-frequency temperature time series from Lake Erken, Sweden, we found a rapid increase in the occasions of negative Tw-Ta with increasing annual mean Ta since 1989.

The project has been making a considerable contribution to the collection and sharing of bird observations, even in the data-poorest countries, and is accelerating the accumulation of bird records globally. On 22 March 2018 eBird surpassed \u00bd billion bird observations.</p>\n  <p>A primary component of ensuring the best quality data is the network of more than 1300 volunteer reviewers who scour incoming data for accuracy. Reviewers provide active feedback to participants on everything from bird identification to best practices for data collection. Since eBird's inception in 2002, almost 23 million observations have been reviewed, requiring more than 190,000 hours of effort by reviewers. In this presentation we review how eBird recruits expert reviewers, describe their responsibilities, and offer some insight in new developments to improve the reviewing process.</p>\n  <p><b>How are reviewers recruited.</b> There are three primary methods that used to identify new reviewers. First, if we don't have any active participants in a region (e.g., Kamchatka Russia) eBird staff search birding listserves to find an individual who is reporting a lot of high-quality observations from the area. We then contact those individuals and offer them the opportunity to review records for the region. This option has the lowest likelihood of success. Second, if an individual is submitting a lot of records to eBird from a region that needs a reviewer we contact them and request their participation. Third, in much of the world eBird has partner groups. These partner organizations (e.g., Taiwan, Spain, India, Portugal, Australia, and all of the Western Hemisphere) recruit their own reviewers. The third method is the most effective way to gain expert participation.</p>\n  <p><b>What does a reviewer do</b>? eBird reviewers work to improve eBird data in three primary areas. First, they develop and manage the eBird checklist filters for a region. These filters generate a checklist of birds for a particular time and location, and determine what records get flagged for further review. Second, if an eBird participant tries to report a species that is not on the checklist, or if the number of individuals of a species exceeds the filter limit, then these records get flagged for review. Reviewers contact the observer and request further documentation. Currently, 57% of all records that are evaluated by reviewers are validated. Finally, eBird reviewers validate whether the participant is eBirding correctly. That is, are they correctly filling out the information on when, where, and how they went birding. It has been our experience that different types of reviewers are required to effectively review eBird submissions: those who are good at reviewing bird records and those who are good at educating observers on how to participate.</p>\n  <p><b>What are future plans</b>? eBird will move towards more effective reviewer teams, where the volume of observations can be split amongst a number of individuals with different strengths, allowing identification experts to focus on observation-level ID issues; and strong communicators to focus on working with contributors on checklist-level best practices. Currently, a single eBird review platform handles a broad array of different reviewing functions. It is our intent to split some of these functions into multiple platforms. For example, right now all review happens at the database level of the 'observation': a record of a taxon at a date and location. Plans are underway to develop tools that will allow reviewers to work at the entire checklist level (i.e., to more easily review the accuracy of how all the observations during a checklist event were submitted), which will enable much more effective review of checklist-level data quality concerns.</p>","doi":"10.3897/biss.2.25394","imprint":{"publisher":"Pensoft Publishers"},"journal":{"issue":"","pages":"e25394","title":"Biodiversity Information Science and Standards","volume":"2"},"keywords":["eBird","data quality","citizen science","data review"],"license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"publication_date":"2018-05-17","relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1252570"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1252569"}}]},"resource_type":{"subtype":"article","title":"Journal article","type":"publication"},"title":"Improving Data Quality in eBird- the Expert Reviewer Network"},"owners":[1161],"revision":3,"stats":{"downloads":15.0,"unique_downloads":15.0,"unique_views":9.0,"version_downloads":15.0,"version_unique_downloads":15.0,"version_unique_views":9.0,"version_views":9.0,"version_volume":990225.0,"views":9.0,"volume":990225.0},"updated":"2019-04-09T13:46:47.978084+00:00"},{"conceptrecid":"1140608","created":"2018-01-09T13:57:30.204787+00:00","doi":"10.3897/tdwgproceedings.1.20400","files":[{"bucket":"1fcc211a-14fe-421c-a618-cc8c8d1bfbdd","checksum":"md5:495260315c5962be2168dab53abc2c30","key":"BISS_article_20400.pdf","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/1fcc211a-14fe-421c-a618-cc8c8d1bfbdd/BISS_article_20400.pdf"},"size":94222,"type":"pdf"},{"bucket":"1fcc211a-14fe-421c-a618-cc8c8d1bfbdd","checksum":"md5:c02fcc77514373f58a3ee43380a6094a","key":"BISS_article_20400.xml","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/1fcc211a-14fe-421c-a618-cc8c8d1bfbdd/BISS_article_20400.xml"},"size":18564,"type":"xml"}],"id":1140609,"links":{"badge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.3897/tdwgproceedings.1.20400.svg","bucket":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/1fcc211a-14fe-421c-a618-cc8c8d1bfbdd","doi":"https://doi.org/10.3897/tdwgproceedings.1.20400","html":"https://zenodo.org/record/1140609","latest":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/1140609","latest_html":"https://zenodo.org/record/1140609","self":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/1140609"},"metadata":{"access_right":"open","access_right_category":"success","communities":[{"id":"biosyslit"}],"creators":[{"affiliation":"Ecole Polytechnique, Palaiseau, France","name":"Zhu, Yue"},{"affiliation":"UPMC Paris 6 - Sorbonne Universit\u00e9s -- LIP6, Paris, France","name":"Durand, Thibaut"},{"affiliation":"IRD, Paris, France","name":"Chenin, Eric"},{"affiliation":"Institut de Syst\u00e9matique, \u00c9volution, Biodiversit\u00e9 ISYEB - UMR 7205 \u2013 CNRS, MNHN, UPMC, EPHE Mus\u00e9um national d'Histoire naturelle, Sorbonne Universit\u00e9s, Paris, France","name":"Pignal, Marc"},{"affiliation":"UPMC Paris 6 - Sorbonne Universit\u00e9s -- LIP6, Paris, France","name":"Gallinari, Patrick"},{"affiliation":"Institut de Syst\u00e9matique, \u00c9volution, Biodiversit\u00e9 ISYEB - UMR 7205 \u2013 CNRS, MNHN, UPMC, EPHE UPMC Univ.

However, ecological or morphological traits describing specimens are rarely recorded while gathering data. \u00a0This lack limits queries and analyses. Manual tagging of millions of specimens will be a huge task even with the help of citizen science projects such as \"les herbonautes\"\u00a0(<u>http://lesherbonautes.mnhn.fr</u>). On the other hand, deep learning methods that use convolutional neural networks (CNN) demonstrate their efficiency in various domains, such as computer vision (Krizhevsky et al. 2012,\u00a0Azizpour et al. 2016), speech recognition (Abdel-Hamid et al. 2014) or face identification (Li et al. 2015,\u00a0Freytag et al. 2016).</p>\n  <p>We aim to use deep learning to provide a visual representation of words used to describe plants (e.g. <em>simple</em>, or <em>compound</em> leaf), and to associate those words with\u00a0specimens in the Paris herbarium. \u00a0This will provide a semantic description of each of the 7 millions images of the fully digitized collection of the Paris herbarium in the Mus\u00e9um National d'Histoire Naturelle (MNHN, Paris, France). In a proof of concept project, we have used a CNN\u00a0- pre-trained on the image database ImageNet (http://www.image-net.org) - in order to identify 4 morphological traits of leaves, using 103,000 herbarium images from 11 different taxa: margin (entire / dentate), leaf attachment (opposite / alternate), leaf organization (simple / compound), plant (woody / non-woody) (see\u00a0Fig. 1)\u00a0Seventy percent of images are used to train the weights of the model (in a supervised learning process that uses a training set already tagged for the 4 characteristics), 10% are used as validation set to tune the hyper-parameters of the model and to avoid overfitting, and 20% are used as test set to evaluate the generalization performances of\u00a0the final neural network. The first results are encouraging with over 80%\u00a0success on the test set. In a second step, we test if the neural network is not overfitting the training examples, and can generalize\u00a0to new taxa. If we restrict the training set to a small number of taxa (4 taxa containing 76% of images), the success rate\u00a0on the 7 other\u00a0taxa (unseen during training) decreases drastically.\u00a0A good sampling of the taxonomic diversity of plants appears crucial to train the neural network. A second method visualizes the area of each image that was detected by the CNN as the most important for morphological character recognition (Durand et al. 2017). This method provides an explanatory view of the automatic recognition process. In this poster we describe methods and results on botanical images for the different taxa. We discuss perspectives on image tagging of the Paris herbarium, and how to combine the citizen science project in order to annotate images with CNN automatic image description.</p>","doi":"10.3897/tdwgproceedings.1.20400","imprint":{"publisher":"Pensoft Publishers"},"journal":{"issue":"","pages":"e20400","title":"Biodiversity Information Science and Standards","volume":"1"},"keywords":["Deep learning","convolutionnal neural network","herbarium","image","morphology"],"license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"publication_date":"2017-08-18","relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1140609"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1140608"}}]},"resource_type":{"subtype":"article","title":"Journal article","type":"publication"},"title":"Using a Deep Convolutional Neural Network for Extracting Morphological Traits from Herbarium Images"},"owners":[1161],"revision":4,"stats":{"downloads":11.0,"unique_downloads":11.0,"unique_views":3.0,"version_downloads":11.0,"version_unique_downloads":11.0,"version_unique_views":3.0,"version_views":3.0,"version_volume":1036442.0,"views":3.0,"volume":1036442.0},"updated":"2019-04-09T13:26:54.798011+00:00"},{"conceptrecid":"899066","created":"2017-09-21T06:41:38.276942+00:00","doi":"10.3897/natureconservation.20.12704","files":[{"bucket":"bc727530-7967-486f-b10c-0a0c597bb589","checksum":"md5:e203b779148b277aca450b3654526761","key":"NC_article_12704.pdf","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/bc727530-7967-486f-b10c-0a0c597bb589/NC_article_12704.pdf"},"size":1430895,"type":"pdf"},{"bucket":"bc727530-7967-486f-b10c-0a0c597bb589","checksum":"md5:668648e906d5509281e344830dae8f67","key":"NC_article_12704.xml","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/bc727530-7967-486f-b10c-0a0c597bb589/NC_article_12704.xml"},"size":226052,"type":"xml"}],"id":899067,"links":{"badge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.3897/natureconservation.20.12704.svg","bucket":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/bc727530-7967-486f-b10c-0a0c597bb589","doi":"https://doi.org/10.3897/natureconservation.20.12704","html":"https://zenodo.org/record/899067","latest":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/899067","latest_html":"https://zenodo.org/record/899067","self":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/899067"},"metadata":{"access_right":"open","access_right_category":"success","communities":[{"id":"biosyslit"}],"creators":[{"affiliation":"Centro Nazionale per lo Studio e la Conservazione della Biodiversit\u00e0 Forestale Carabinieri \"Bosco Fontana\", Verona, Italy","name":"Campanaro, Alessandro"},{"affiliation":"Centro Nazionale per lo Studio e la Conservazione della Biodiversit\u00e0 Forestale Carabinieri \"Bosco Fontana\", Verona, Italy","name":"Hardersen, S\u00f6nke"},{"affiliation":"Centro Nazionale per lo Studio e la Conservazione della Biodiversit\u00e0 Forestale Carabinieri \"Bosco Fontana\", Verona, Italy","name":"Redolfi De Zan, Lara"},{"affiliation":"Universit\u00e0 di Roma \"La Sapienza\", Roma, Italy","name":"Antonini, Gloria"},{"affiliation":"Centro Nazionale per lo Studio e la Conservazione della Biodiversit\u00e0 Forestale Carabinieri \"Bosco Fontana\", Verona, Italy","name":"Bardiani, Marco"},{"affiliation":"Consiglio per la ricerca in agricoltura e l'analisi dell'economia agraria, Firenze, Italy","name":"Maura, Michela"},{"affiliation":"Consiglio per la ricerca in agricoltura e l'analisi dell'economia agraria, Firenze, Italy","name":"Maurizi, Emanuela"},{"affiliation":"Consiglio per la ricerca in agricoltura e l'analisi dell'economia agraria, Firenze, Italy","name":"Mosconi, Fabio"},{"affiliation":"Consiglio per la ricerca in agricoltura e l'analisi dell'economia agraria, Firenze, Italy","name":"Zauli, Agnese"},{"affiliation":"Universit\u00e0 Roma Tre, Roma, Italy","name":"Bologna, Marco Alberto"},{"affiliation":"Consiglio per la ricerca in agricoltura e l'analisi dell'economia agraria, Firenze, Italy","name":"Roversi, Pio Federico"},{"affiliation":"Consiglio per la ricerca in agricoltura e l'analisi dell'economia agraria, Firenze, Italy","name":"Sabbatini Peverieri, Giuseppino"},{"affiliation":"Centro Nazionale per lo Studio e la Conservazione della Biodiversit\u00e0 Forestale Carabinieri \"Bosco Fontana\", Verona, Italy","name":"Mason, Franco"}],"description":"<p>Citizen science, the engagement of people in a research project, has grown rapidly in recent years, also for mapping of species of conservation interest. The Life Project \"Monitoring Insects with Public Participation\" (MIPP) actively promoted collaboration amongst scientists, public administrations and citizens in the collection of occurrence data of nine insect species listed in the Habitats Directive: Lucanus cervus, Osmoderma eremita, Cerambyx cerdo, Rosalia alpina, Morimus asper/funereus, Lopinga achine, Parnassius apollo, Zerynthia cassandra/polyxena and Saga pedo. These species were selected because they share two main characteristics: (i) they are listed in Annexes II and IV of the Habitats Directive and (ii) they are large and relatively easy to identify. From 2014 to 2016, many different strategies were applied to contact and engage the public and approximately 14,000 citizens were reached directly. Additionally, printed and online material informed the public about this project. Citizens could transmit data on the target species, accompanied by a photograph, via the web-site of the project or through a dedicated application (app) for smartphones and tablets. All records were validated by experts based on the photographs sent by citizens. A total number of 2,308 records were transmitted and 1,691 (73.2%) of these were confirmed. Most of the reports were submitted via the website, although the submission via the app increased over time. The species most commonly recorded was L. cervus, followed by M. asper/funereus and R. alpina. Data collected by citizen scientists allowed a detailed analysis to be made on altitudinal distribution and phenology of the species and the results obtained were compared with literature data on altitudinal distribution and phenology. For example, for L. cervus, 67% of the records collected were from the altitudinal range 0\u2013400 m a.s.l. Interestingly, the data showed that the phenology of this species changed with altitude.</p>","doi":"10.3897/natureconservation.20.12704","imprint":{"publisher":"Pensoft Publishers"},"journal":{"issue":"","pages":"265-297","title":"Nature Conservation","volume":"20"},"keywords":["Citizen Science","Habitats Directive","Phenology","Altitudinal distribution"],"license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"publication_date":"2017-08-28","relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"899067"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"899066"}}]},"resource_type":{"subtype":"article","title":"Journal article","type":"publication"},"title":"Analyses of occurrence data of protected insect species collected by citizens in Italy"},"owners":[1161],"revision":4,"stats":{"downloads":11.0,"unique_downloads":11.0,"unique_views":4.0,"version_downloads":11.0,"version_unique_downloads":11.0,"version_unique_views":4.0,"version_views":4.0,"version_volume":15739845.0,"views":4.0,"volume":15739845.0},"updated":"2019-03-20T22:01:11.497270+00:00"},{"conceptrecid":"2581866","created":"2019-03-02T12:03:55.695534+00:00","doi":"10.1007/s10531-017-1492-8","files":[{"bucket":"cf9c1f01-709d-41e0-9c57-dee3d37ab0f0","checksum":"md5:01dc71d446be7a9355f575b4e2a3ff81","key":"Di Camillo et al 2017.pdf","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/cf9c1f01-709d-41e0-9c57-dee3d37ab0f0/Di%20Camillo%20et%20al%202017.pdf"},"size":3366684,"type":"pdf"}],"id":2581867,"links":{"badge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.1007/s10531-017-1492-8.svg","bucket":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/cf9c1f01-709d-41e0-9c57-dee3d37ab0f0","doi":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10531-017-1492-8","html":"https://zenodo.org/record/2581867","latest":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/2581867","latest_html":"https://zenodo.org/record/2581867","self":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/2581867"},"metadata":{"access_right":"open","access_right_category":"success","alternate_identifiers":[{"identifier":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10531-017-1492-8","scheme":"url"}],"communities":[{"id":"greenbubbles"}],"creators":[{"affiliation":"Department of Life  and Environmental Sciences Marche Polytechnic University, CoNISMa, Ancona, Italy","name":"Di Camillo, Cristina Gioia"},{"affiliation":"Department of Biological, Geological and Environmental Sciences and Interdepartmental Research Centre for Environmental Sciences, University of Bologna, CoNISMa, Ravenna, Italy","name":"Ponti, Massimo"},{"affiliation":"Department of Earth, Environment and Life SciencesUniversity of Genoa, CoNISMa, Genoa, Italy","name":"Bavestrello, Giorgio"},{"affiliation":"Department of Marine Studies, University of Split, Split, Croatia","name":"Krzelj, Maja"},{"affiliation":"Department of Life  and Environmental Sciences Marche Polytechnic University, CoNISMa, Ancona, Italy","name":"Cerrano, Carlo"}],"description":"<p>In the Mediterranean, habitat-forming corals often characterize essential fish habitats. While their distribution is sufficiently known for the western basin, few data are available from the Central-Eastern Mediterranean Sea (CEM). This study fills this gap supplying the largest dataset ever built on the geographical and bathymetric distribution of the most relevant habitat-forming corals (<em>Eunicella cavolini</em>, <em>Eunicella verrucosa</em>, <em>Eunicella singularis</em>, <em>Leptogorgia sarmentosa</em>, <em>Paramuricea clavata</em>, <em>Corallium rubrum</em> and <em>Savalia savaglia</em>) of the CEM. Information collected from different sources such as literature, citizen science, and from the World Wide Web (WWW) was combined. Videos published on the WWW provided additional information on the presence of fishing lines and signs of damage, as well as on the distribution of purple and yellow-purple colonies of <em>Paramuricea clavata</em>. The study highlighted the impressive amount of information that the WWW can offer to scientists, termed here as Web Ecological Knowledge (WEK). The WEK is constantly fuelled by internauts, representing a free, refreshable, long-term exploitable reservoir of information. A quick and easy method to retrieve data from the WWW was illustrated. In addition, the distribution of corals was overlapped to marine protected areas and to the distribution of environmental conditions suitable for coralligenous habitats, fragile biogenic Mediterranean structures hosting complex assemblages in need of strict protection. The collected data allowed identifying priority areas with high species diversity and sites that are impacted by fishing activities. Supplied data can correctly address conservation and restoration policies in the CEM, adding an important contribution to ecosystem-based marine spatial planning.</p>","doi":"10.1007/s10531-017-1492-8","grants":[{"acronym":"MERCES","code":"689518","funder":{"acronyms":["EC"],"doi":"10.13039/501100000780","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/funders/10.13039/501100000780"},"name":"European Commission"},"links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/grants/10.13039/501100000780::689518"},"program":"H2020","title":"Marine Ecosystem Restoration in Changing European Seas"},{"acronym":"GreenBubbles","code":"643712","funder":{"acronyms":["EC"],"doi":"10.13039/501100000780","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/funders/10.13039/501100000780"},"name":"European Commission"},"links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/grants/10.13039/501100000780::643712"},"program":"H2020","title":"Green Bubbles RISE for sustainable diving"}],"journal":{"issue":"5","pages":"1257-1276","title":"Biodiversity and Conservation","volume":"27"},"keywords":["Biogeography","Citizen Science","Foundation species","Mesophotic habitats","Social media","European Union (EU)","Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions","Grant Agreement No 643712","Green Bubbles RISE for sustainable diving","Green Bubbles"],"license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"notes":"This is a post-peer-review, pre-copyedit version of an article published in Biodiversity and Conservation on 23 December 2017 (First Online).

The evidence reinforces the idea of community social capital, with caregivers and professionals playing a leading role. Yet, the cost of collective action is mainly supported by individuals with a mental condition - which unveils their vulnerability. The results are in general agreement with previous findings but, since we broaden the perspective of previous studies, we are also able to find marked differences in the social behavior of certain groups of mental disorders.

In the XIXth century the number of Heteroptera species records from the present territory of Poland increased rapidly, mainly due to the faunistic studies by both, German (Weigel 1806; Schilling 1827, 1837; Gravenhorst 1836; Siebold 1839; Scholtz 1847; Schramm 1848; Assmann 1854) and Polish (Gorski 1852; Waga 1857; Nowicki 1864, 1865, 1867, 1868, 1870a, b; \u0141omnicki 1882; Stobiecki 1883; Kotula 1890) entomologists. Till the end of the XIXth century, 438 species of terrestrial Heteroptera have been recorded from the present territory of Poland; all those records are presented in the Fig. 1. In the first half of the twentieth century, faunistic studies on the terrestrial Heteroptera in Poland have also been conducted predominantly by German entomologists (Kuhlgatz 1901, Enderlein 1906, Stichel 1923, Laske 1928, Schmidt 1928, Gruhl 1929, Scholz 1931, Schubert 1934, Karl 1935, Engel i Hedicke 1936, Michalk 1936, Pax 1937, Lanzke i Polentz 1942), but papers by the Polish authors have also been published (Smreczy\u0144ski 1906, Szulczewski 1908, Stobiecki 1915, Krasucki 1916, Tenenbaum 1921, Strawi\u0144ski 1926, Ruszkowski 1933, Obarski 1938). Till 1945 the number of Heteroptera species recorded from the present territory of Poland increased to 578 with many new records from the regions not studied before (Fig. 2). In the second half of the XXth century the first keys for the identification of Polish Heteroptera (Wr&oacute;blewski 1968; Cmoluchowa 1978), and the first comprehensive faunistic reviews of several true-bugs families (Lis J.A. 1990a, b) have been published what had a great impact on further development of faunistic studies in Poland. The XXth century has ended with 673 species of terrestrial Heteroptera recorded from Poland, and the number of known Polish records has doubled in comparison to the year 1945 (till that year we have about 9 800 records, whereas till the end of the XXth century &ndash; about 18&nbsp;400 records: see Fig. 3 and Fig. 5). The beginning of the XXI century brings the data growth of further 11&nbsp;000 records (Fig. 4) and several species recorded in our country for the first time (Fig. 6). At present, the best investigated regions are, as follows: several cities and their surroundings (Cracow, Wroc\u0142aw, Bytom, Pozna\u0144, Przemy\u015bl, Zwierzyniec, Pu\u0142awy), Bia\u0142owie\u017ca Primeval Forest, Ojc&oacute;w National Park, Pieniny Mountains, Gorce Mountains, Bukowa G&oacute;ra reserve, and Bielinek on the Odra River reserve (Fig. 7). However, only 3% of the territory of Poland are very well studied, since only in 82 UTM squares (out of almost 3400) at least 100 Heteroptera species have been recorded, so far. Moreover, at least one species has been recorded in 1200 UTM squares (it is about one third of the Polish UTM squares). Although faunistic studies are very important from many points of view and are the basis for zoocenology, zoogeography, or phylogeography, their traditions in Poland are not as well established as in other European countries. Comprehensive nature of such studies, including a necessity of involving many specialists and the lack of time and resources to cover the entire country area, makes them not very popular in Poland. Therefore, the citizen science initiatives in Polish Heteroptera defined as &ldquo;the collection and analysis of data by non-professional entomologists as part of a collaborative project with professional scientists&rdquo; would be a great opportunity to gather more new faunistic data from our country. Moreover, the citizen science would be also very important in early detection of alien Heteroptera pest species introduced to our country.</p>","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.2550100","journal":{"pages":"1-8","title":"Heteroptera Poloniae - Acta Faunistica","volume":"13"},"keywords":["Hemiptera","Heteroptera","true-bugs","faunistics","distribution","Poland"],"language":"pol","license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"publication_date":"2019-01-28","related_identifiers":[{"identifier":"10.5281/zenodo.2550099","relation":"isVersionOf","scheme":"doi"}],"relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"2550100"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"2550099"}}]},"resource_type":{"subtype":"article","title":"Journal article","type":"publication"},"title":"Badania faunistyczne nad l\u0105dowymi pluskwiakami r\u00f3\u017cnoskrzyd\u0142ymi (Hemiptera: Heteroptera) w Polsce: rys historyczny i perspektywy [Faunistic researches on terrestrial true-bugs (Hemiptera: Heteroptera) in Poland: a historical background and perspectives]"},"owners":[54262],"revision":3,"stats":{"downloads":38.0,"unique_downloads":36.0,"unique_views":39.0,"version_downloads":38.0,"version_unique_downloads":36.0,"version_unique_views":39.0,"version_views":43.0,"version_volume":53922684.0,"views":43.0,"volume":53922684.0},"updated":"2019-04-10T03:23:47.172564+00:00"},{"conceptrecid":"3251256","created":"2019-06-21T04:33:00.468188+00:00","doi":"10.3897/biss.3.36153","files":[{"bucket":"c2e72aaf-c145-4bc7-86c5-fd6b2dc7d38a","checksum":"md5:84b6a8d5df4b7183f709cae483f4b8de","key":"BISS_article_36153.pdf","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/c2e72aaf-c145-4bc7-86c5-fd6b2dc7d38a/BISS_article_36153.pdf"},"size":75401,"type":"pdf"},{"bucket":"c2e72aaf-c145-4bc7-86c5-fd6b2dc7d38a","checksum":"md5:296e665b8f0c5f6eb87e002be02434df","key":"BISS_article_36153.xml","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/c2e72aaf-c145-4bc7-86c5-fd6b2dc7d38a/BISS_article_36153.xml"},"size":14305,"type":"xml"}],"id":3251257,"links":{"badge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.3897/biss.3.36153.svg","bucket":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/c2e72aaf-c145-4bc7-86c5-fd6b2dc7d38a","doi":"https://doi.org/10.3897/biss.3.36153","html":"https://zenodo.org/record/3251257","latest":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/3251257","latest_html":"https://zenodo.org/record/3251257","self":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/3251257"},"metadata":{"access_right":"open","access_right_category":"success","communities":[{"id":"biosyslit"}],"creators":[{"affiliation":"University of Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal","name":"Dias da Silva, Ana Margarida"},{"affiliation":"Science Museum of the University of Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal|Centre for Functional Ecology, Department of Life Sciences, University of Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal","name":"Gir\u00e3o da Cruz, M.

At the University of Coimbra\u00a0(UC), the Life Sciences Department safeguards almost 5000 letters and other documentation addressed to directors, gardeners and other collaborators of the Botanic Garden.

Received correspondence is a great resource for understanding the process of knowledge creation and circulation in the plant sciences, including botany and agriculture, as well as the scientific colonial practices and their implication for the amassing of biological collections at the UC.</p>\n  <p>In order to uncover historical biodiversity data within this archival material, we have implemented <em>Plant Letters </em>(<u>https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/catedraunesco/plant-letters</u>), a citizen science transcription project that seeks to uncover the stories within these historical archives, the tales of travelers and scientists, on the quest of recording of the world's diversity, mostly in the Portuguese ex-colonies in sub-Saharan Africa. Using the collaborative platform Zooniverse (<u>https://www.zooniverse.org)</u>, users are requested to engage with the archive and transcribe mostly handwritten letters in several languages, giving dimension to our continuous efforts of promoting open and widespread access to information. The project invites everyone to transcribe handwritten or typed letters received by the Botanic Garden between about 1870 and 1928, from more than 1100 correspondents from around the world.</p>\n  <p>The main purpose of this project is to track plant species, locations and scientists in the correspondence received in the 19<sup>th</sup> and 20<sup>th</sup> centuries at the Botanic Garden of the University of Coimbra. To do so, <em>Plant Letters</em> seeks in users, both experts or simply curious, a source of participation in the construction of knowledge, making use of collective intelligence, in a lively exchange of information, experiences and knowledge.</p>\n  <p>In transcribing the letters, we want to retrieve information that can include:</p>\n  <ul>\n    inquiries and doubts about plant classification and taxonomy;\n    historical plant species locations, distribution records and abundance;\n    biological material circulation (plant and seed exchanges);\n    track the path of herbarium and museum specimens in our collections;\n    unravel networks of botanical knowledge.\n  </ul>\n  <p>Transcribing the information contained in these documents will allow us to: track plant specimens as they travelled from their native countries to the scientists who named them; to determine historical plant locations in parts of sub-Saharan Africa; to better understand the scientific processes of plant discovery, taxonomy and botany;\u00a0and\u00a0to collect information that gives context to biological specimens in museum objects and other natural history collections. All of these data, valuable to the present and future conservation of tropical flora, will be made available, bearing in mind the open science principles.</p>","doi":"10.3897/biss.3.36153","imprint":{"publisher":"Pensoft Publishers"},"journal":{"issue":"","pages":"e36153","title":"Biodiversity Information Science and

scope</strong></p>\n\n<p>Member State authorities are required to report on the distribution in their territory of each of the invasive alien species (IAS) of Union concern. These are species with documented biodiversity impacts sensu the European Union Regulation on the prevention and management of the introduction and spread of Invasive Alien Species in Europe (IAS Regulation No 1143/2014) (European Union 2014). This distribution represents the official reporting under Article 24(1) of R.1143/2014 on invasive alien species for the period 2015&ndash;2018. Baseline distribution of these species has previously been reported and published (Adriaens et al. 2018, ).</p>\n\n<p>Data were compiled from various datasets holding invasive species observations such as data from research institutes and research projects (9%), citizen science observatories (68%) and a range of other sources (23%) such as&nbsp;governmental agencies, water managers etc. More specifically the dataset includes:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>The citizen science recording portals www.waarnemingen.be and www.observation.be which has a specific alert system for IAS where nature volunteers can report their observations (Adriaens et al. 2018);</li>\n\t<li>Data from the Research Institute for Nature and Forest (INBO), the Flemish government institute that coordinates N2000, WFD and BIrd Directive and IAS monitoring in the terrestrial, estuarine and freshwater environment;</li>\n\t<li>Data from the Flemish Environment Agency which performs management of muskrat and invasive water plants in Flanders, gathered with a dedicated smartphone app since 2015;</li>\n\t<li>Data from the Flemish provinces and Rato vzw that manage water plants, muskrat, giant hogweed etc.;</li>\n\t<li>Some smaller datasets from cities;</li>\n\t<li>Data from the Brussels Capital Region from the Brussels Environment data portal;</li>\n\t<li>Plant inventories of the &lsquo;contrats de rivi&egrave;re&rsquo; along watercourses in Wallonia, making use of a dedicated application to collect data directly from the field (fulcrum);</li>\n\t<li>The government reporting portals for IAS of the &lsquo;Observatoire wallon de la flore, de la faune et des habitats (Service Public de Wallonie)&rsquo;;</li>\n\t<li>Some validated data from specific datasets on gbif (iNaturalist, Natusfera, Naturgucker).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Data were normalized using a custom mapping of the original data files to Darwin Core (Wieczorek et al. 2012) where possible. Species names were mapped to the GBIF Backbone Taxonomy (GBIF 2016) using the species API (http://www.gbif.org/developer/species). The mapping was assisted by dedicated software (SMARTIE) which was specifically written for the purpose of aggregating IAS data from various sources. Appropriate selection of records was performed based on the cut-off dates (see data range) and record content validation (see validation procedure). Data were then joined with GRID10k layer Belgium based on GRID10k cellcodes (ETRS_1989_LAEA).&nbsp;The technical format is in line with the <a href=\"http://cdr.eionet.europa.eu/help/ias_regulation/material/IAS-species-distribution-user-manual\">guidelines</a> provided to the member states for the compilation of reports on Species Distribution (SD) of Invasive Alien Species of Union concern.</p>\n\n<p><strong>File description</strong></p>\n\n<p>The dataset contains a shapefiles (<em>T1_Belgium_Union_List_Species.shp</em>) with the distribution of the species of Union Concern at 10km<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;(European Terrestrial Reference System projection - 1989 ETRS_1989_LAEA) level. The attributes table contains <em>Cellcode </em>(ETRS<sup>&nbsp;</sup>grid cell code)&nbsp;and <em>Species </em>(scientific name + authority).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Date range</strong></p>\n\n<p>The data reflects the distribution of the IAS of Union concern in Belgium in the first reporting period for the EU Regulation hence comprises observations of Union List invasive species between January 2015 (2015-01-01) and December 2018 (2018-12-31).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Validation procedure</strong></p>\n\n<p>Record validation was performed to exclude dubious records, wrong identifications etc. This was done based on the IdentificationVerificationStatus field (to which validation information from original data were mapped) if available. In general, non-validated data were not considered. Data were validated in the original datasets based on evidence (e.g. pictures), on the observer&rsquo;s experience, or based on a set of predefined rules (e.g. automated validation based on geographic filtering). Data from research institutes were generally considered validated. A few casual records of EU list species that were clearly planted were discarded manually. When the original dataset did not mention any validation status, records were not considered validated and therefore not taken into account&nbsp;unless for Chinese mitten crab&nbsp;<em>Eriocheir sinensis</em>, ruddy duck&nbsp;<em>Oxyura jamaicensis</em>, raccoon&nbsp;<em>Procyon lotor</em>, Siberian ground squirrel&nbsp;<em>Tamias sibiricus</em>, sacred ibis&nbsp;<em>Threskiornis aethiopicus</em>, Egyptian goose&nbsp;<em>Alopochen aegyptiaca,&nbsp;</em>Himalayan balsam&nbsp;<em>Impatiens glandulifera</em>,&nbsp;giant hogweed&nbsp;<em>Heracleum mantegazzianum,&nbsp;</em>muskrat&nbsp;<em>Ondatra zibethicus&nbsp;</em>and red-eared slider&nbsp;<em>Trachemys spp</em>. For these species, it was assumed all records were correct as they originate from dedicated sampling (<em>E. sinensis</em>) within research projects, were gathered by public bodies (e.g. muskrat), or represent species that are readily recognizable by people in the field. Data provided by EASIN in the care package and GBIF data were carefully checked.</p>\n\n<p>A visual check was performed on the resulting distribution maps by representatives of the Belgian national scientific council on invasive alien species, an official consultative structure coordinating scientific input and data aggregation between Belgian regions and institutions with regards to technical implementation of the Regulation No 1143/2014 on invasive alien species.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Data providers</strong></p>\n\n<p>The providers of the invasive species data for this exercise (individuals and their respective organizations) are listed in the &quot;data providers&quot; section of the dataset metadata. Much of the primary occurrence data that formed the basis for this aggregated dataset will be published as open data on the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF).</p>","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.3060173","keywords":["biodiversity","invasive alien species","biological invasions","distribution","Europe","Regulation","EASIN","Belgium"],"language":"eng","license":{"id":"CC0-1.0"},"publication_date":"2019-05-20","references":["Adriaens, T. et al.

The overarching objective of SSNet is to advance knowledge on the role of small streams in water quality, biodiversity and ecosystem services protection that will inform policy, measures and management options to meet water quality and other resources protection targets. The project will start with a synthesis of available information on the importance of small streams to initiate communication with stakeholders and introduce the project. This will be followed by a compilation and analysis of existing data on small streams in Ireland to inform the selection of sites for the proposed research. Three work packages will collect new data on hydrochemistry with a focus on the nutrient retention potential of headwater streams, hydromorphology and biodiversity. All three investigations will share common sites to enable interconnections between the three elements to be explored and provide an integrated approach to the research. Modelling based on the results from each of the aforementioned tasks will be used to estimate the level of intervention in the small stream network required to have measurable effects throughout a catchment on both water quality (N, P &amp; sediment) and flows, and overall delivery/maintenance of ecosystem services. We will also engage volunteers in both biological water quality and hydromorphological assessments and evaluate the potential of citizen science in facilitating greater monitoring coverage of the

However, these data are not available even for the world\u2019s most notorious invasive species. Here we introduce the Global Garlic Mustard Field Survey, a coordinated distributed field survey to collect performance data and germplasm from a single invasive species: garlic mustard (<i>Alliaria petiolata</i>) across its entire distribution using minimal resources. We chose this species for its ecological impacts, prominence in ecological studies of invasion success, simple life history, and several genetic and life history attributes that make it amenable to experimental study. We developed a standardised field survey protocol to estimate population size (area) and density, age structure, plant size and fecundity, as well as damage by herbivores and pathogens in each population, and to collect representative seed samples. Across four years and with contributions from 164 academic and non-academic participants from 16 countries in North America and Europe thus far, we have collected 45,788 measurements and counts of 137,811 plants from 383 populations and seeds from over 5,000 plants. All field data and seed resources will be curated for release to the scientific community. Our goal is to establish <i>A</i>. <i>petiolata</i> as a model species for plant invasion biology and to encourage large collaborative studies of other invasive species.</p>","doi":"10.3897/neobiota.21.5242","journal":{"issue":"","pages":"29-47","title":"NeoBiota","volume":"21"},"keywords":["Alliaria petiolata","citizen science","model system","plant invasion","research network"],"license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"publication_date":"2014-04-17","relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"574734"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"778753"}}]},"resource_type":{"subtype":"article","title":"Journal article","type":"publication"},"title":"The Global Garlic Mustard Field Survey (GGMFS): challenges and opportunities of a unique, large-scale collaboration for invasion biology"},"owners":[1161],"revision":5,"stats":{"downloads":2.0,"unique_downloads":2.0,"unique_views":5.0,"version_downloads":2.0,"version_unique_downloads":2.0,"version_unique_views":5.0,"version_views":5.0,"version_volume":5327912.0,"views":5.0,"volume":5327912.0},"updated":"2019-02-18T21:20:11.480950+00:00"},{"conceptrecid":"635618","created":"2016-06-06T08:30:05+00:00","doi":"10.3897/zookeys.585.8019","files":[{"bucket":"7e55941e-a394-4adc-b54e-9ec9f276013b","checksum":"md5:4de67bd6e0c2cd6872f9c8482cfd141d","key":"ZK_article_8019.xml","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/7e55941e-a394-4adc-b54e-9ec9f276013b/ZK_article_8019.xml"},"size":117987,"type":"xml"},{"bucket":"7e55941e-a394-4adc-b54e-9ec9f276013b","checksum":"md5:ae667231f4e8315adf4c3d085cfa1cce","key":"ZK_article_8019.pdf","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/7e55941e-a394-4adc-b54e-9ec9f276013b/ZK_article_8019.pdf"},"size":1848369,"type":"pdf"}],"id":53825,"links":{"badge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.3897/zookeys.585.8019.svg","bucket":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/7e55941e-a394-4adc-b54e-9ec9f276013b","doi":"https://doi.org/10.3897/zookeys.585.8019","html":"https://zenodo.org/record/53825","latest":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/53825","latest_html":"https://zenodo.org/record/53825","self":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/53825"},"metadata":{"access_right":"open","access_right_category":"success","communities":[{"id":"biosyslit"}],"creators":[{"affiliation":"Research Institute for Nature and Forest (INBO), Brussels, Belgium","name":"Maes, Dirk"},{"affiliation":"Natuurpunt Studie, Mechelen, Belgium","name":"Vanreusel, Wouter"},{"affiliation":"Natuurpunt Studie, Mechelen, Belgium","name":"Herremans, Marc"},{"affiliation":"Vlinderwerkgroep Natuurpunt, Mechelen, Belgium","name":"Vantieghem, Pieter"},{"affiliation":"Research Institute for Nature and Forest (INBO), Brussels, Belgium","name":"Brosens, Dimitri"},{"affiliation":"Natuurpunt Studie, Mechelen, Belgium","name":"Gielen, Karin"},{"affiliation":"Leefmilieu Brussel/BIM, Brussels, Belgium","name":"Beck, Olivier"},{"affiliation":"Universit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium","name":"Van Dyck, Hans"},{"affiliation":"Research Institute for Nature and Forest (INBO), Brussels, Belgium","name":"Desmet, Peter"},{"affiliation":"Vlinderwerkgroep Natuurpunt, Mechelen, Belgium","name":"Natuurpunt, Vlinderwerkgroep"}],"description":"<p>In this data paper, we describe two datasets derived from two sources, which collectively represent the most complete overview of butterflies in Flanders and the Brussels Capital Region (northern Belgium).

There were 6 experimental stations, one per individual, spatially distributed so that participants could not see each other. Also, they were rigorously prevented from talking or signaling one another. To further guarantee that potential interactions among players did not influence the results of the experiment, the assignment of players&rsquo; partners was completely random. All of the participants played through Citizen Social Lab, a web interface specifically developed for the experiment.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The participants were shown a brief tutorial, but were not given any clue. They were informed that they had to make decisions under different conditions and against different opponents. We made sure the interface be the most simple and understandable to ensure the correct understanding of the tasks. Also, the interface was the same for everybody. We made sure to avoid the research be upsetting or harmful for the participants by presenting the experiment as a game and playful activity.

It will do this by implementing a generative research cycle involving networking, dialogue, participatory research and interpretation phases centered around and driven by children and young people, out of which a diverse range of outputs, critical perspectives and other insights will emerge to inform policy and decision-making in relation to children and young people&rsquo;s needs in relation to digital society.

The objectives of this deliverable were to develop (1) a strategy for a global GEO\u00a0BON infrastructure with optimised functionality in terms of efficiency and operability (as part of Task 7.4), and (2) a business plan for sustaining the European Biodiversity Observation Network after the funded phase (as part of Task 7.5).</p>\n\n<p>Building on the outputs from other EU BON work packages and extensive consultation (including externally to the project consortium), these objectives have been met. The global and European-level map of the biodiversity informatics landscape (Task 7.4) has led to a better understanding of the landscape\u2019s current structure and functioning. This will enable key players to establish or strengthen collaborations, avoid effort duplication, and facilitate access to the biodiversity data, information and knowledge required to support effective decision-making. The business plan for the European Biodiversity Observation Network (Task 7.5) summarises what the network has to offer, to identified end-users (from policy, science/research, and citizen-science), in terms of products, tools and services, including those that can potentially generate income.

The region possesses few biological collections within the universities and nature reserves. Still, the Department of Natural Resources pays considerable attention to the sustainable use of natural resources. On the global scale, the success of biodiversity informatics goals largely depends on the local initiatives and progress in data mobilization and sharing. Therefore, organization of regional biodiversity portals is important to promote data mobilization, education and citizen science on local scale.</p>\n  <p>Previous experience of biodiversity information systems in the region was low. The program on digitization of observations of Red Listed species was launched in 2010 under the support of the Department of Natural Resources of Yugra. The information system for Red Listed species registrations was developed through this project and currently includes about three thousand observations. Another example of digitization in Western Siberia was developed by the biological collection of Yugra State University. Its database is based on the database management system Specify and available online through its web portal (http://bioportal.ugrasu.ru). Some collections of nature reserves have their catalogues in digital form. The need of biodiversity data mobilization is well understood and is discussed at regular workshops on biological collections management held in Khanty-Mansiysk.</p>\n  <p>Recently, the biologists curating several biological collections in the region started a project on a regional biodiversity portal development (https://nwsbios.org).

Here we compare the results of in-house verses out-sourced data transcription with the aim of evaluating the pros and cons of each approach and guiding future projects that want to do the same.</p>\n  <p>In 2014 Meise Botanic Garden (BR) embarked on a mass digitization project. We digitally imaged of some 1.2 million herbarium specimens from our African and Belgian Herbaria. The minimal data for a third of these images was transcribed in-house, while the remainder was out-sourced to a commercial company. The minimal data comprised the fields: specimen's herbarium location, barcode, filing name, family, collector, collector number, country code and phytoregion (for the Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda &amp; Burundi). The out-sourced data capture consisted of three types:</p>\n  \n    additional label information for central African specimens having minimal data;\n    complete data for the remaining African specimens; and,\n    species filing name information for African and Belgian specimens without minimal data. As part of the preparation for out-sourcing, a strict protocol had to be established as to the criteria for acceptable data quality levels.\n  \n  <p>Also, the creation of several lookup tables for data entry was necessary to improve data quality. During the start-up phase all the data were checked, feedback given, compromises made and the protocol amended. After this phase, an agreed upon subsample was quality controlled. If the error score exceeded the agreed level, the batch was returned for retyping. The data had three quality control checks during the process, by the data capturers, the contractor's project managers and ourselves.</p>\n  <p>Data quality was analysed and compared in-house versus out-sourced modes of data capture. The error rate by our staff versus the external company was comparable. The types of error that occurred were often linked to the specific field in question. These errors include problems of interpretation, legibility, foreign languages, typographic errors, etc. A significant amount of data cleaning and post-capture processing was required prior to import into our database, despite the data being of good quality according to protocol (error &lt; 1%). By improving the workflow and field definitions a notable improvement could be made in the \"data cleaning\" phase.</p>\n  <p>The initial motivation for capturing some data in-house was financial. However, after analysis, this may not have been the most cost effective approach. Many lessons have been learned from this first mass digitisation project that will implemented in similar projects in the future.</p>","doi":"10.3897/biss.2.26514","imprint":{"publisher":"Pensoft Publishers"},"journal":{"issue":"","pages":"e26514","title":"Biodiversity Information Science and Standards","volume":"2"},"keywords":["mass digitisation","crowd sourcing","citizen science","data quality control"],"license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"publication_date":"2018-05-21","relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1254702"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1254701"}}]},"resource_type":{"subtype":"article","title":"Journal article","type":"publication"},"title":"An Evaluation of In-house versus Out-sourced Data Capture at the Meise Botanic Garden (BR)"},"owners":[1161],"revision":4,"stats":{"downloads":16.0,"unique_downloads":16.0,"unique_views":7.0,"version_downloads":16.0,"version_unique_downloads":16.0,"version_unique_views":7.0,"version_views":7.0,"version_volume":1142896.0,"views":7.0,"volume":1142896.0},"updated":"2019-04-09T13:47:14.602643+00:00"},{"conceptdoi":"10.5281/zenodo.3257549","conceptrecid":"3257549","created":"2019-07-29T18:49:03.490785+00:00","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.3354489","files":[{"bucket":"f7496f7b-f6a4-470a-b819-f31693916188","checksum":"md5:c4f8070d8cc3230e4a873ece7ab3a3ce","key":"Report_Habitatge.pdf","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/f7496f7b-f6a4-470a-b819-f31693916188/Report_Habitatge.pdf"},"size":5265855,"type":"pdf"}],"id":3354489,"links":{"badge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.3354489.svg","bucket":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/f7496f7b-f6a4-470a-b819-f31693916188","conceptbadge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.3257549.svg","conceptdoi":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3257549","doi":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3354489","html":"https://zenodo.org/record/3354489","latest":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/3354489","latest_html":"https://zenodo.org/record/3354489","self":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/3354489"},"metadata":{"access_right":"open","access_right_category":"success","creators":[{"affiliation":"OpenSystems, Universitat de Barcelona","name":"Vicens, Juli\u00e1n","orcid":"0000-0003-0643-0469"},{"affiliation":"OpenSystems, Universitat de Barcelona","name":"Cigarini, Anna","orcid":"0000-0002-9328-8589"},{"affiliation":"OpenSystems, Universitat de Barcelona","name":"Perell\u00f3, Josep","orcid":"0000-0001-8533-6539"}],"description":"<p>Al llarg del proc&eacute;s de cocreaci&oacute; amb les comunitats de les biblioteques de Fort Pienc (Barcelona), Olesa de Montserrat i Granollers, les seves professionals s&rsquo;han erigit com a facilitadores d&rsquo;una recerca de ci&egrave;ncia ciutadana on els col&middot;lectius participants (40-45 usuaris/&agrave;ries de promig) i les seves viv&egrave;ncies i preocupacions han estat els principals motors de la recerca.&nbsp;Amb l&rsquo;objectiu com&uacute; de donar veu a una inquietud compartida pel conjunt de les comunitats motor sobre a l&rsquo;acc&eacute;s a l&rsquo;habitatge, s&rsquo;han dut a terme tres intervencions al carrer (una intervenci&oacute; durant tot un dia, una per cada municipi) que simulen el mercat del lloguer en forma de joc i que interpel&middot;len a ve&iuml;ns i ve&iuml;nes a posar-se en la situaci&oacute; de llogar un habitatge.

I describe the creation of a species distribution EBV for the United Kingdom, covering 5293 species from 1970-2015. The data product contains an annual occupancy estimate for every species in each year, each with a measure of uncertainty. I will describe the workflow to produce this data product. The data collation step bring togehter different sources of occurrence records; the data standardisation step harmonizes these records to a common spatio-temporal resolution. These data are then converted into a set of 'detection histories' for each species within each taxonomic group, before being passed to the occupancy-detection model. Outputs from this model are then summarised as 1000 samples from the postierior distribution of occupancy estimates for each species:year combination. I will also describe the infrastructure requirements to create the EBV and to update it annually. This endeavour has been made possible because the vast majority of the 34 million species records have been collated and curated by 31 taxon-oriented citizen science groups. I go on to describe the challenges of harmonizing and integrating these occurrence records with other data types, such as from systematic surveys, including count data. Such \"integrated models\" are statisitcally challenging, but now within reach, thanks to the development of new tools that make it possible to conceive of modelling everything, everywhere. However, a substantial and concerted effort is required to curate biodiversity data in a way that maximises their potential for the next generation of models, and for truly global EBVs.</p>","doi":"10.3897/biss.3.37898","imprint":{"publisher":"Pensoft Publishers"},"journal":{"issue":"","pages":"e37898","title":"Biodiversity Information Science and Standards","volume":"3"},"keywords":["EBV","occupancy model"],"license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"publication_date":"2019-07-04","relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"3333087"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"3333086"}}]},"resource_type":{"subtype":"article","title":"Journal article","type":"publication"},"title":"Towards an annual species distribution EBV for the United Kingdom"},"owners":[1161],"revision":2,"stats":{"downloads":2.0,"unique_downloads":2.0,"unique_views":2.0,"version_downloads":2.0,"version_unique_downloads":2.0,"version_unique_views":2.0,"version_views":2.0,"version_volume":117414.0,"views":2.0,"volume":117414.0},"updated":"2019-07-12T07:05:48.534054+00:00"},{"conceptdoi":"10.5281/zenodo.1434701","conceptrecid":"1434701","created":"2018-12-12T10:37:31.381866+00:00","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.2222342","files":[{"bucket":"39c7aec6-46d0-4d59-9739-26c5eec4cb2e","checksum":"md5:80d8594ff931a9823cbc2efa1fe59026","key":"measurements_arduino.xlsx","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/39c7aec6-46d0-4d59-9739-26c5eec4cb2e/measurements_arduino.xlsx"},"size":53815509,"type":"xlsx"},{"bucket":"39c7aec6-46d0-4d59-9739-26c5eec4cb2e","checksum":"md5:6780d68e5dc0b2dbea4da0f8617c3a45","key":"measurements_bleair.xlsx","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/39c7aec6-46d0-4d59-9739-26c5eec4cb2e/measurements_bleair.xlsx"},"size":38021,"type":"xlsx"},{"bucket":"39c7aec6-46d0-4d59-9739-26c5eec4cb2e","checksum":"md5:edd8486380654bf235cf0f2d54a335bf","key":"measurements_sky_photos.xlsx","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/39c7aec6-46d0-4d59-9739-26c5eec4cb2e/measurements_sky_photos.xlsx"},"size":22777229,"type":"xlsx"}],"id":2222342,"links":{"badge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.2222342.svg","bucket":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/39c7aec6-46d0-4d59-9739-26c5eec4cb2e","conceptbadge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.1434701.svg","conceptdoi":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1434701","doi":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2222342","html":"https://zenodo.org/record/2222342","latest":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/2222342","latest_html":"https://zenodo.org/record/2222342","self":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/2222342"},"metadata":{"access_right":"open","access_right_category":"success","communities":[{"id":"h2020-hackair"}],"creators":[{"affiliation":"DRAXIS Environmental S.A.","name":"Panagiota Syropoulou","orcid":"0000-0003-2665-8831"},{"affiliation":"ITI-CERTH","name":"Anastasia Moumtzidou"},{"affiliation":"ITI-CERTH","name":"Symeon (Akis) Papadopoulos"},{"affiliation":"ITI-CERTH","name":"Eleftherios Spyromitros-Xioufis"},{"affiliation":"NILU","name":"Philipp Schneider"},{"affiliation":"NILU","name":"Hai-Ying Liu"},{"affiliation":"NILU","name":"Sonja Grossberndt"},{"affiliation":"BUND","name":"Arne Fellermann"},{"affiliation":"Technological Educational Institution of Athens","name":"Ilias Stavrakas"},{"affiliation":"Democritus University of Thrace","name":"Konstantinos Kourtidis"},{"affiliation":"imec","name":"Carina Veeckman"},{"affiliation":"OnSubject","name":"Wiebke Herding"}],"description":"<p>The current datasets comprise of air quality data collected or created within the hackAIR project (https://platform.hackair.eu/) all around Europe from February 2018 until November&nbsp;2018.</p>\n\n<p>i) &quot;measurements_arduino.xlsx&quot;: PM10 and PM2.5 measurements collected by hackAIR users with stationary hackAIR sensors (https://www.hackair.eu/hackair-home-v2/).

Hace apenas unas d&eacute;cadas era inimaginable la creciente influencia que la ciudadan&iacute;a iba a tener en la marcha de la ciencia. Y, aunque algunos movimientos de activistas contra las nucleares lograron en los 80 situar en la agenda pol&iacute;tica de muchos gobiernos la resistencia popular al desarrollo de esta fuente de energ&iacute;a, lo cierto es que la presencia hoy de las ONG en la toma de decisiones comienza a ser algo habitual y, en algunos casos, alcanza la condici&oacute;n de estructural. Las sociedades modernas han necesitado explorar formas muy innovadoras de organizaci&oacute;n social que les permitan afrontar las nuevas encrucijadas a las que nos aboca la llamada sociedad del riesgo. Nadie discute que estamos hablando de asuntos de extrema gravedad, como lo manifiesta la experiencia adquirida durante las anteriores crisis del SIDA, de los alimentos y cultivos transg&eacute;nicos y de las vacas locas. En su conjunto, los tres casos se&ntilde;alados (entre los muchos que podr&iacute;amos mencionar) comparten algunos aspectos que aqu&iacute; queremos subrayar. Quienes desde responsabilidades de gobierno o empresariales lamentaron el desbordamiento del tradicional sistema de expertos por los movimientos de agitaci&oacute;n ciudadana, aprendieron que la gesti&oacute;n de estos conflictos tiene que ser menos vertical y m&aacute;s dialogante.

Wildlife-vehicle collisions (WVC) can occur frequently when wildlife are present, impacting drivers and animals. Because collisions are often avoidable with constructed mitigation and reduced speeds, transportation agencies often want to know where they can act most effectively and what kinds of mitigation are cost-effective. For this study, WVC occurrences were obtained from two sources: 1) highway agencies that monitor carcass retrieval and disposal by agency maintenance staff and 2) opportunistic observations of carcasses by participants in two statewide systems, the California Roadkill Observation System (CROS; http://wildlifecrossing.net/california) and the Maine Audubon Wildlife Road Watch (MAWRW; http://wildlifecrossing.net/maine). Between September, 2009 and December 31, 2014, &gt;33,700 independent observations of &gt;450 vertebrate species had been recorded in these online, form-based informatics systems by &gt;1,300 observers. We asked whether or not WVC observations collected by these extensive, volunteer-science networks could be used to inform transportation-mitigation planning. Cluster analyses of volunteer-observed WVC were performed using spatial autocorrelation tests for parts or all of 34 state highways and interstates. Statistically-significant WVC hotspots were modeled using the Getis-Ord Gi* statistic. High density locations of WVC, that were not necessarily hotspots, were also visualized. Statistically-significant hotspots were identified along ~7,900 km of highways. These hotspots are shown to vary in position from year to year. For highways with frequent deer-vehicle collisions, annual costs from collisions ranged from US$0 to &gt;US$30,000/km. Carcass clusters from volunteer data had very little or no overlap with similar findings from agency-collected WVC data, during a different time-range. We show that both state agency-collected and volunteer-collection of WVC observations could be useful in prioritizing mitigation action at US state-scales by state transportation agencies to protect biodiversity and driver safety. Because of the spatial extent and taxonomic accuracy at which volunteer observations can be collected, these may be the most important source of data for transportation agencies to protect drivers and wildlife.</p>","doi":"10.3897/natureconservation.11.4438","journal":{"issue":"","pages":"41-60","title":"Nature Conservation","volume":"11"},"keywords":["Transportation","Wildlife-Vehicle

Data obtained from the British Spider Recording Scheme demonstrate that the species moved significantly northwards since the report of the first populations in the very South of England, after several decades of relative stasis. The sudden northward expansion highly correlates with a massive rise in press coverage of the species.</p>\n        <p>In the Americas, S. nobilis is currently known from four countries (USA, Chile, Ecuador, Colombia), and available DNA barcoding data obtained for specimens from this area suggest that multiple introductions occurred within each country. Using ecological niche modeling, we identified suitable climate regions for the species and discuss possible reasons for its current spread. We propose that seaside cities and villages with a temperate oceanic or Mediterranean climate are especially favourable potential habitats for S. nobilis and will face the highest colonization pressure in the future, while tropical upland regions with temperate climates are also vulnerable to invasion by S. nobilis.</p>","doi":"10.3897/neobiota.42.31582","imprint":{"publisher":"Pensoft Publishers"},"journal":{"issue":"","pages":"19-43","title":"NeoBiota","volume":"42"},"keywords":["alien species","araneism","biological invasion","citizen science","spider","steatodism"],"license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"publication_date":"2019-02-11","relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"2572072"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"2572071"}}]},"resource_type":{"subtype":"article","title":"Journal article","type":"publication"},"title":"Steatoda nobilis, a false widow on the rise: a synthesis of past and current distribution trends"},"owners":[1161],"revision":2,"stats":{"downloads":3.0,"unique_downloads":3.0,"unique_views":4.0,"version_downloads":3.0,"version_unique_downloads":3.0,"version_unique_views":4.0,"version_views":4.0,"version_volume":7621497.0,"views":4.0,"volume":7621497.0},"updated":"2019-02-19T13:32:55.420916+00:00"},{"conceptdoi":"10.5281/zenodo.1284090","conceptrecid":"1284090","created":"2018-11-04T19:37:14.402801+00:00","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.1284091","files":[{"bucket":"509d062a-fbb5-4b27-b341-4cde1d19afb9","checksum":"md5:221633346ab03bc0d15194358e0bf6c1","key":"QuestionsAnswers.xlsx","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/509d062a-fbb5-4b27-b341-4cde1d19afb9/QuestionsAnswers.xlsx"},"size":27303,"type":"xlsx"},{"bucket":"509d062a-fbb5-4b27-b341-4cde1d19afb9","checksum":"md5:745b7b6b05bad0e1ba64c54e83f74b3c","key":"round.csv","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/509d062a-fbb5-4b27-b341-4cde1d19afb9/round.csv"},"size":37824,"type":"csv"},{"bucket":"509d062a-fbb5-4b27-b341-4cde1d19afb9","checksum":"md5:93391a5bf839d2201b9e57ed2de7e28c","key":"session.csv","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/509d062a-fbb5-4b27-b341-4cde1d19afb9/session.csv"},"size":4577,"type":"csv"},{"bucket":"509d062a-fbb5-4b27-b341-4cde1d19afb9","checksum":"md5:01acd6c5f8249f76afa802fab7badd8b","key":"user.csv","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/509d062a-fbb5-4b27-b341-4cde1d19afb9/user.csv"},"size":23166,"type":"csv"},{"bucket":"509d062a-fbb5-4b27-b341-4cde1d19afb9","checksum":"md5:88f8b57212f18fbbd9f082f2539abe57","key":"userround.csv","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/509d062a-fbb5-4b27-b341-4cde1d19afb9/userround.csv"},"size":142954,"type":"csv"}],"id":1284091,"links":{"badge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.1284091.svg","bucket":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/509d062a-fbb5-4b27-b341-4cde1d19afb9","conceptbadge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.1284090.svg","conceptdoi":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1284090","doi":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1284091","html":"https://zenodo.org/record/1284091","latest":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/1284091","latest_html":"https://zenodo.org/record/1284091","self":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/1284091"},"metadata":{"access_right":"open","access_right_category":"success","creators":[{"affiliation":"Universitat de Barcelona","name":"Vicens, Juli\u00e1n","orcid":"0000-0003-0643-0469"},{"affiliation":"Universidad Pontificia de Comillas","name":"Bueno-Guerra, Nereida","orcid":"0000-0003-1442-7905"},{"affiliation":"University of Warwick","name":"Gutierrez-Roig, Mario","orcid":"0000-0003-2045-1493"},{"affiliation":"University of Zaragoza","name":"Gracia-L\u00e1zaro, Carlos","orcid":"0000-0002-9769-8796"},{"affiliation":"University of Zaragoza","name":"G\u00f3mez-Garde\u00f1es, Jes\u00fas","orcid":"0000-0001-5204-1937"},{"affiliation":"Universitat de Barcelona","name":"Perell\u00f3, Josep","orcid":"0000-0001-8533-6539"},{"affiliation":"Universidad Carlos III de Madrid","name":"S\u00e1nchez, \u00c1ngel","orcid":"0000-0003-1874-2881"},{"affiliation":"University of Zaragoza","name":"Moreno, Yamir","orcid":"0000-0002-0895-1893"},{"affiliation":"Universitat Rovira i Virgili","name":"Duch, Jordi","orcid":"0000-0003-2639-6333"}],"description":"<p>Climate change mitigation is a shared global challenge that involves the collective action of a set of individuals with different tendencies to cooperation.

Hudson, born 1867 in London, developed a strong interest in nature when he was nine years old and began collecting insects. At the age of 13 he wrote and illustrated his first manuscript on insects.</p>\n  <p>In 1881 Hudson moved to New Zealand, where he worked as a clerk in the post office in Wellington until his retirement in 1919. However, he kept collecting, investigating and describing insects in his spare time, and was determined to present New Zealand's insect fauna to the general public. He was critical of the formal education system and provided alternative methods of learning through his books. His achievements place him among New Zealand's distinguished pioneer naturalists.</p>\n  <p>After Hudson's death in April 1946, his collection of insects, one of the largest and most valuable private collection in New Zealand, was donated to the Dominion Museum with the condition that it remained intact in its nine original cabinets. These are made from kauri and are full of neatly pinned in sects, Hudson invented his own coding system for labelling his specimens. The numbers that refer to each specimen were recorded in three volumes of register books, where he noted details about the samples. These registers are the only way we can understand the collection. However, since Hudson had a very idiosyncratic handwriting and wrote between lines when he ran out of space, his registers are very hard to read. Also, he changed names, deleted numbers of specimens that were given away and reused those numbers. In short, these registers were living documents that changed with the collection.</p>\n  <p>This collection is of immense scientific value and it has been well protected in climate-controlled conditions, although quite inaccessible for many years. Now, the kauri cabinets are secured to shelving units bolted to the floor and a wall. This provides protection against flooding and earthquake hazards. The registers and the specimens in the drawers are part of a digitisation program. All the information on the aging register pages were scanned in high resolution. It is now possible to magnify the writing and transfer the data into a database without touching the vulnerable originals. It is also possible to share the scanned pages with volunteers and experts, who can help deciphering Hudson's notes. The plan is to make some of the pages available online, as part of a citizen science project.</p>","doi":"10.3897/biss.2.27006","imprint":{"publisher":"Pensoft Publishers"},"journal":{"issue":"","pages":"e27006","title":"Biodiversity Information Science and Standards","volume":"2"},"keywords":["Collection access and use","Digitisation","Volunteers"],"license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"publication_date":"2018-06-13","relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1294478"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1294477"}}]},"resource_type":{"subtype":"article","title":"Journal article","type":"publication"},"title":"The Treasure of George Vernon Hudson"},"owners":[1161],"revision":4,"stats":{"downloads":20.0,"unique_downloads":18.0,"unique_views":7.0,"version_downloads":20.0,"version_unique_downloads":18.0,"version_unique_views":7.0,"version_views":7.0,"version_volume":758216.0,"views":7.0,"volume":758216.0},"updated":"2019-04-09T13:59:38.069804+00:00"},{"conceptrecid":"1304496","created":"2018-07-04T04:30:06.712364+00:00","doi":"10.3897/BDJ.6.e21282","files":[{"bucket":"97381f11-cd3a-4958-b348-5832f47058c5","checksum":"md5:656685eaf2096a71d3ceead2a582fe3c","key":"BDJ_article_21282.pdf","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/97381f11-cd3a-4958-b348-5832f47058c5/BDJ_article_21282.pdf"},"size":972598,"type":"pdf"},{"bucket":"97381f11-cd3a-4958-b348-5832f47058c5","checksum":"md5:63e6f6564b62c0ec73806c9c35b83688","key":"BDJ_article_21282.xml","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/97381f11-cd3a-4958-b348-5832f47058c5/BDJ_article_21282.xml"},"size":94991,"type":"xml"}],"id":1304497,"links":{"badge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.3897/BDJ.6.e21282.svg","bucket":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/97381f11-cd3a-4958-b348-5832f47058c5","doi":"https://doi.org/10.3897/BDJ.6.e21282","html":"https://zenodo.org/record/1304497","latest":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/1304497","latest_html":"https://zenodo.org/record/1304497","self":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/1304497"},"metadata":{"access_right":"open","access_right_category":"success","communities":[{"id":"biosyslit"}],"creators":[{"affiliation":"Costa Rica Institute of Technology (ITCR), Cartago, Costa Rica","name":"Mora, Maria"},{"affiliation":"Costa Rica Institute of Technology (ITCR), Cartago, Costa Rica","name":"Araya, Jos\u00e9"}],"description":"<p>Taxonomic literature keeps records of the planet's biodiversity and gives access to the knowledge needed for its sustainable management. Unfortunately, most of the taxonomic information is available in scientific publications in text format. The amount of publications generated is very large; therefore, to process it in order to obtain high structured texts would be complex and very expensive. Approaches like citizen science may help the process by selecting whole fragments of texts dealing with morphological descriptions; but a deeper analysis, compatible with accepted ontologies, will require specialised tools. The Biodiversity Heritage Library (BHL) estimates that there are more than 120 million pages published in over 5.4 million books since 1469, plus about 800,000 monographs and 40,000 journal titles (12,500 of these are current titles).</p>\n  <p>It is necessary to develop standards and software tools to extract, integrate and publish this information into existing free and open access repositories of biodiversity knowledge to support science, education and biodiversity conservation.</p>\n  <p>This document presents an algorithm based on computational linguistics techniques to extract structured information from morphological descriptions of plants written in Spanish. The developed algorithm is based on the work of Dr. Hong Cui from the University of Arizona; it uses semantic analysis, ontologies and a repository of knowledge acquired from the same descriptions. The algorithm was applied to the books Trees of Costa Rica Volume III (TCRv3), Trees of Costa Rica Volume IV (TCRv4) and to a subset of descriptions of the Manual of Plants of Costa Rica (MPCR) with very competitive results (more than 92.5% of average performance). The system receives the morphological descriptions in tabular format and generates XML documents. The XML schema allows documenting structures, characters and relations between characters and structures. Each extracted object is associated with attributes like name, value, modifiers, restrictions, ontology term id, amongst other attributes.</p>\n  <p>The implemented tool is free software.

In addition, databases and online solutions exist that are more directly research-oriented but still offer participation by citizen scientists, such as the PlutoF (University of Tartu Natural History Museum 2016) platform. The University of Tartu Natural History Museum maintains the PlutoF platform (Abarenkov et al. 2010) for storing and managing biodiversity data, including taxon observations. In 2014, development was started to integrate an observation app \"Minu loodusheli\"/\"My naturesound\" (University of Tartu Natural History Museum 2017b) (My naturesound, Fig. 1) within PlutoF system. In 2017, an English language version of the app (University of Tartu Natural History Museum 2017c) was launched that includes nearly all major sound-producing taxon groups in its taxonomy. The application also acts as a practical tool for collecting and publishing occurrence data for the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (Global Biodiversity Information Facility 2017) in standardized Darwin Core format together with download links to the multimedia files.

Out of these species, a monitoring programme has only been established for Lucanus cervus, which partially includes participation of non-experts. In 2015 and 2016, a public campaign was organised in order to collect observations of Lucanus cervus and two other saproxylic beetles that are easily recognisable by the public: Morimus funereus and Rosalia alpina. Data gathered through this campaign serve as an addition to the mapping activities and monitoring of the species' range. So far, more than 650 citizen observations have been collected, providing data on species presence in 216 10\u00d710 km<sup>2</sup> grid cells intended for reporting on the species' range. Besides the public campaign, since 2014, public institutions for managing nature protected values have been involved in population monitoring for which they received education through several workshops. Altogether, 21 sites have been included in the monitoring of the stag beetle so far. Data collected for Lucanus cervus on standard transects, by tree and ground pitfall traps and tree trunk surveys at night will be discussed.

As this forestry crop grows in popularity around the world, the exotic introduction of pests such as the leaf beetles belonging to the genera Paropsis Oliver, 1807 and Paropsisterna Motschulsky, 1860 increases in frequency. These pest introductions have spurred a need to understand the natural enemies of these pests for use in classical biological control programs. One such enemy, Eadya paropsidis Huddleston &amp; Short, 1978 (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), has shown potential as a biological control agent against Paropsis charybdis, an exotic pest of New Zealand Eucalyptus plantations. However, observations made by biocontrol researchers have raised concerns that E. paropsidis is a complex of cryptic species. A comprehensive large-scale phylogenetic study utilizing both host and molecular data (Peixoto et al. 2018), as well as a morphological multivariate ratio analysis, was utilized to ensure accurate delimitation of the species of Eadya. Here we formally describe the three new species (Eadya annleckieae Ridenbaugh, 2018, sp. n., Eadya daenerys Ridenbaugh, 2018, sp. n., Eadya spitzer Ridenbaugh, 2018, sp. n.), and one additional new species discovered in the Australian National Insect Collection (Eadya duncan Ridenbaugh, 2018, sp. n.). All distributions and host associations for Eadya are listed as well as a redescription of the originally described E. paropsidis and E. falcata. An illustrated key to all known species is included to assist biological control researchers. The value of citizen science observations is discussed, along with the need for a further understanding of mainland Eadya populations given the recent spread of paropsine pests. Finally, we discuss the subfamilial placement of Eadya, and suggest it belongs within Euphorinae based on morphological characters.</p>","doi":"10.3897/jhr.64.24282","imprint":{"publisher":"Pensoft Publishers"},"journal":{"issue":"","pages":"141-175","title":"Journal of Hymenoptera Research","volume":"64"},"keywords":["Animalia","Arthropoda","Insecta","Hymenoptera","Ichneumonoidea","Braconidae","Eadya","Plantae","Tracheophyta","Magnoliopsida","Myrtales","Myrtaceae","Eucalyptus","Parasitoid wasps","Taxonomy","DNA Barcoding","Morphometrics","Biological Control","Tasmania","New South Wales","Victoria","Euphorinae","Eucalyptus"],"license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"publication_date":"2018-06-25","relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1303458"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1303457"}}]},"resource_type":{"subtype":"article","title":"Journal article","type":"publication"},"title":"Description of four new species of Eadya (Hymenoptera, Braconidae), parasitoids of the Eucalyptus Tortoise Beetle (Paropsis charybdis) and other Eucalyptus defoliating leaf beetles"},"owners":[1161],"revision":3,"stats":{"downloads":15.0,"unique_downloads":15.0,"unique_views":6.0,"version_downloads":15.0,"version_unique_downloads":15.0,"version_unique_views":6.0,"version_views":6.0,"version_volume":238432275.0,"views":6.0,"volume":238432275.0},"updated":"2019-04-09T14:01:58.352810+00:00"},{"conceptrecid":"605741","created":"2016-02-15T10:13:54+00:00","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.11864","files":[{"bucket":"1edd61b2-3533-4738-a686-9a5a839b5489","checksum":"md5:65cef3b6b4c2404787d3e664c7d579b0","key":"Vision_Statement_on_Transatlantic_Ocean_Literacy_2014.pdf","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/1edd61b2-3533-4738-a686-9a5a839b5489/Vision_Statement_on_Transatlantic_Ocean_Literacy_2014.pdf"},"size":620417,"type":"pdf"}],"id":11864,"links":{"badge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.11864.svg","bucket":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/1edd61b2-3533-4738-a686-9a5a839b5489","doi":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11864","html":"https://zenodo.org/record/11864","latest":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/11864","latest_html":"https://zenodo.org/record/11864","self":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/11864"},"metadata":{"access_right":"open","access_right_category":"success","communities":[{"id":"euro-basin"},{"id":"ivo_grigorov"},{"id":"oceanliteracy"},{"id":"ecfunded"},{"id":"zenodo"}],"creators":[{"affiliation":"NMEA & College of Exploration, USA","name":"Tuddenham, Peter"},{"affiliation":"EURO-BASIN Project Office, Denmark","name":"Grigorov, Ivo"},{"affiliation":"College of Exploration, USA","name":"Bishop, Tina"},{"affiliation":"Nautilus Educational, Australia","name":"Breidahl, Harry "},{"affiliation":"NAUSICAA, France","name":"Cira, Manuel"},{"affiliation":"European Marine Sciecen Educators Association (EMSEA)","name":"Copejans, Evy"},{"affiliation":"European Marine Sciecen Educators Association (EMSEA)","name":"Crouch, Fiona"},{"affiliation":"Un.

Interlocking efforts bring together international partnerships and networks, national, regional and institutional projects and investments and countless individual contributors, spanning diverse biological and environmental research domains, government agencies and non-governmental organisations, citizen science and commercial enterprise. However, current efforts remain inefficient and inadequate to address the global need for accurate data on the world's species and on changing patterns and trends in biodiversity. Significant challenges include imbalances in regional engagement in biodiversity informatics activity, uneven progress in data mobilisation and sharing, the lack of stable persistent identifiers for data records, redundant and incompatible processes for cleaning and interpreting data and the absence of functional mechanisms for knowledgeable experts to curate and improve data.</p>\n  <p>The first Global Biodiversity Informatics Conference (GBIC) in 2012 delivered the Global Biodiversity Informatics Outlook (GBIO,\u00a0Hobern et al. 2012), an architectural vision for the major components of a distributed global infrastructure for biodiiversity information, but realigning the work\u00a0of existing organisations and projects to achieve this vision remains challenging.\u00a0Recognising the need for greater alignment between efforts at all scales, the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) convened the second Global Biodiversity Informatics Conference (GBIC2) in July 2018 to propose a coordination mechanism for developing shared roadmaps for biodiversity informatics. GBIC2 attendees reached consensus on the need for a global <em>alliance for biodiversity knowledge</em>, learning from examples such as the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) and the open software communities under the Apache Software Foundation. These initiatives provide models for multiple stakeholders with decentralised funding and independent governance to combine resources and develop sustainable solutions that address common needs.</p>\n  <p>GBIF was asked to coordinate next steps following GBIC2, including publication of a paper, Connecting data and expertise: a new alliance for biodiversity knowledge (Hobern et al. 2019). The supplementary materials for the paper include PDF brochures explaining the concept in eleven languages. During 2019, GBIF is coordinating further consultations to establish an optimal model for the governance and operations of the\u00a0<em>alliance</em>\u00a0and to advance collaboration around some of the major building blocks of the GBIO. Collaboration at this scale, and across all aspects of biodiversity information, is essential for effective delivery of important information products such as the Essential Biodiversity Variables and the planned pan-European natural history collections infrastructure, DiSSCo.</p>\n  <p>This presentation explains the goals\u00a0for this alliance and updates on progress during 2019 in operationalising the concept.</p>","doi":"10.3897/biss.3.37324","imprint":{"publisher":"Pensoft Publishers"},"journal":{"issue":"","pages":"e37324","title":"Biodiversity Information Science and Standards","volume":"3"},"keywords":["alliance for biodiversity knowledge","biodiversity informatics","infrastructure","standards","capacity enhancement","international cooperation"],"license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"publication_date":"2019-06-21","relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"3261932"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"3261931"}}]},"resource_type":{"subtype":"article","title":"Journal article","type":"publication"},"title":"An alliance for biodiversity knowledge: Rethinking international collaboration in biodiversity informatics"},"owners":[1161],"revision":2,"stats":{"downloads":3.0,"unique_downloads":3.0,"unique_views":3.0,"version_downloads":3.0,"version_unique_downloads":3.0,"version_unique_views":3.0,"version_views":3.0,"version_volume":249117.0,"views":3.0,"volume":249117.0},"updated":"2019-06-29T07:05:45.853299+00:00"},{"conceptrecid":"3251246","created":"2019-06-21T04:32:39.076542+00:00","doi":"10.3897/biss.3.35829","files":[{"bucket":"65ac7aa9-ecb6-4d83-9e32-04d58c207254","checksum":"md5:c6a530705dfe818c57b7e97ae2e2e8f5","key":"BISS_article_35829.pdf","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/65ac7aa9-ecb6-4d83-9e32-04d58c207254/BISS_article_35829.pdf"},"size":118702,"type":"pdf"},{"bucket":"65ac7aa9-ecb6-4d83-9e32-04d58c207254","checksum":"md5:9fb64d9f4330c157d008453c66c2f1c4","key":"BISS_article_35829.xml","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/65ac7aa9-ecb6-4d83-9e32-04d58c207254/BISS_article_35829.xml"},"size":13841,"type":"xml"}],"id":3251247,"links":{"badge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.3897/biss.3.35829.svg","bucket":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/65ac7aa9-ecb6-4d83-9e32-04d58c207254","doi":"https://doi.org/10.3897/biss.3.35829","html":"https://zenodo.org/record/3251247","latest":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/3251247","latest_html":"https://zenodo.org/record/3251247","self":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/3251247"},"metadata":{"access_right":"open","access_right_category":"success","communities":[{"id":"biosyslit"}],"creators":[{"affiliation":"GBIF, Copenhagen, Denmark","name":"Waller, John"}],"description":"<p>I will cover how the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) handles data quality issues, with specific focus on coordinate location\u00a0issues, such as gridded datasets (Fig. 1) and\u00a0country centroids. I will highlight the challenges GBIF faces identifying potential data quality problems and what we and others (Zizka et al. 2019) are doing to discover and address them.</p>\n  <p>GBIF is the largest open-data portal of biodiversity data, which is a large network of individual datasets (&gt; 40k) from various sources and publishers. Since these datasets are variable both within themselves and dataset-to-dataset, this creates a challenge for users wanting to use data collected from museums, smartphones, atlases, satellite tracking, DNA sequencing, and various other sources for research or analysis.</p>\n  <p>Data quality at GBIF will always be a moving target (Chapman 2005), and GBIF already handles many obvious errors such as zero/impossible coordinates, empty or invalid\u00a0data fields, and fuzzy taxon matching. Since GBIF primarily (but not exclusively) serves lat-lon location information, there is an expectation that occurrences fall somewhat close to where the species actually occurs. This is not always the case. Occurrence data can be hundereds\u00a0of kilometers\u00a0away\u00a0from where the species naturally occur, and there can be multiple reasons for why this can happen, which might not be entirely obvious to users.</p>\n  <p>One reasons is that many GBIF datasets are gridded. Gridded datasets are datasets that have low resolution due to equally-spaced sampling. This can be a data quality issue because a user might assume an occurrence record was recorded exactly at its coordinates.

In this paper we describe how the web application ispotnature.org and its sister site ispot.org.za (collectively, \"iSpot\") are helping to solve this problem by combining learning technology with crowdsourcing to connect beginners with experts. Over 94% of observations submitted to iSpot receive a determination. External checking of a sample of 3,287 iSpot records verified &gt; 92% of them. To mid 2014, iSpot crowdsourced the identification of 30,000 taxa (&gt;80% at species level) in &gt; 390,000 observations with a global community numbering &gt; 42,000 registered participants. More than half the observations on ispotnature.org were named within an hour of submission. iSpot uses a unique, 9-dimensional reputation system to motivate and reward participants and to verify determinations. Taxon-specific reputation points are earned when a participant proposes an identification that achieves agreement from other participants, weighted by the agreers' own reputation scores for the taxon. This system is able to discriminate effectively between competing determinations when two or more are proposed for the same observation. In 57% of such cases the reputation system improved the accuracy of the determination, while in the remainder it either improved precision (e.g. by adding a species name to a genus) or revealed false precision, for example where a determination to species level was not supported by the available evidence. We propose that the success of iSpot arises from the structure of its social network that efficiently connects beginners and experts, overcoming the social as well as geographic barriers that normally separate the two.</p>","doi":"10.3897/zookeys.480.8803","journal":{"issue":"","pages":"125-146","title":"ZooKeys","volume":"480"},"keywords":["Biodiversity","Citizen Science","Crowdsourcing","Identification","Learning","Learning design","social networking"],"license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"publication_date":"2015-02-02","relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"578728"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"784040"}}]},"resource_type":{"subtype":"article","title":"Journal article","type":"publication"},"title":"Crowdsourcing the identification of organisms: A case-study of iSpot"},"owners":[1161],"revision":5,"stats":{"downloads":3.0,"unique_downloads":3.0,"unique_views":5.0,"version_downloads":3.0,"version_unique_downloads":3.0,"version_unique_views":5.0,"version_views":5.0,"version_volume":10942692.0,"views":5.0,"volume":10942692.0},"updated":"2019-02-18T21:26:05.494943+00:00"},{"conceptrecid":"642754","created":"2014-03-10T17:39:50+00:00","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.8306","files":[{"bucket":"02372303-ea55-4468-86d6-d8360a7ece40","checksum":"md5:bb09cbaa852e54c77db3d0201f379c28","key":"ODE-WP3-DEL-0002-1_0_public_final.pdf","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/02372303-ea55-4468-86d6-d8360a7ece40/ODE-WP3-DEL-0002-1_0_public_final.pdf"},"size":552472,"type":"pdf"}],"id":8306,"links":{"badge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.8306.svg","bucket":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/02372303-ea55-4468-86d6-d8360a7ece40","doi":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8306","html":"https://zenodo.org/record/8306","latest":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/8306","latest_html":"https://zenodo.org/record/8306","self":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/8306"},"metadata":{"access_right":"open","access_right_category":"success","communities":[{"id":"ode-project"},{"id":"ecfunded"},{"id":"zenodo"}],"creators":[{"affiliation":"Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research","name":"Sch\u00e4fer, Angela"},{"affiliation":"Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research","name":"Pampel, Heinz"},{"affiliation":"Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research","name":"Pfeiffenberger, Hans"},{"affiliation":"CERN","name":"Dallmeier-Tiessen, Sunje"},{"affiliation":"CSC - IT Center for Science Ltd.","name":"Tissari, Satu"},{"affiliation":"STFC Rutherford Appleton Laboratory","name":"Darby, Robert"},{"affiliation":"Alliance for Permanent Access","name":"Giaretta, Krystina"},{"affiliation":"Alliance for Permanent Access","name":"Giaretta, David"},{"affiliation":"Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research","name":"Gitmans, Kathrin"},{"affiliation":"CSC - IT Center for Science Ltd.","name":"Helin, Heikki"},{"affiliation":"STFC Rutherford Appleton Laboratory","name":"Lambert, Simon "},{"affiliation":"CERN","name":"Mele, Salvatore"},{"affiliation":"LIBER \u2013 Association of European Research Libraries","name":"Reilly, Susan"},{"affiliation":"CERN","name":"Ruiz, Sergio"},{"affiliation":"CSC - IT Center for Science Ltd.","name":"Sandberg, Marie"},{"affiliation":"LIBER \u2013 Association of European Research Libraries","name":"Schallier, Wouter"},{"affiliation":"Deutsche Nationalbibliothek,","name":"Schrimpf, Sabine "},{"affiliation":"The International Association of STM Publishers","name":"Smit, Eefke"},{"affiliation":"The British Library,","name":"Wilkinson, Max"},{"affiliation":"STFC Rutherford Appleton Laboratory","name":"Wilson, Michael"}],"description":"<p>To gain a broad and common understanding the ODE project collected 21 stories, in which significant stakeholders describe their experiences and their view on the topic.

The labels of these specimens contain valuable information for research, but their transcription can be difficult and time-consuming, with often hard to read handwritten labels. Whilst accurate label transcription is only one step along the way to create a specimen record fit for different research uses, it is an extremely important one. It would be very time-consuming to have to return to recheck label information for even a very small proportion of specimens.\u00a0Once a specimen\u00a0label\u00a0is transcribed correctly, it becomes much easier to enhance the record with additional information from other sources, e.g. from literature or collector itineraries. It also becomes feasible to determine the point of collection from the textual information on the label by a process known as georeferencing, or even to find inaccuracies within the label itself.</p>\n  <p>Under\u00a0the auspices of\u00a0the project Innovation and Consolidation for Large Scale Digitisation of Natural Heritage (ICEDIG), we\u00a0compared different manual approaches to transcription of\u00a0collection labels. Using herbarium specimens as an example, the quality of transcribed data by:</p>\n  \n    in-house trained institute staff,\n    outsourcing to a commercial company or\n    transcription by the general public through online crowdsourcing platforms was compared through two transcription pilots.\n  \n  <p>The first pilot consisted of 200 S<em>olanum</em> specimen images from the Royal Botanic Gardens Kew in the UK and 200 from Meise Botanic Garden in Belgium. This particular genus was chosen as both institutes had specimens from which the label data had already been transcribed through the digitisation company Picturae, completed by Alembo. The Kew specimens had also been transcribed in-house by staff employed as digitisation officers or curators\u00a0and by an independant researcher. The images from both institutes were uploaded to two crowdsourcing platforms: DigiVol and DoeDat. In a second pilot, multiple European institutions holding botanical collections were approached to provide a sample of 200 digitally imaged herbarium sheet specimens to upload to multiple crowdsourcing platforms. Specimens from 7 institutions were uploaded for transcription to 5 different crowdsourcing platforms: DigiVol, DoeDat, Die Herbonauten, Les Herbonautes and Notes from Nature.</p>\n  <p>For both pilots, key transcription data were assessed and common errors in label transcription identified.

In order to address a gap in research literature, this paper deals with a survey conducted to assess the current state of geo-crowdsourcing, a recent phenomenon popular with people who collect geographic information using their smartphones. This article points out that there is an increasing body of knowledge of geo-crowdsourcing mobile applications in the Visegrad countries marked by the ubiquitous Internet connection and the current massive proliferation of smartphones. This article shows how geo-crowdsourcing can be used as a complement, or in some cases a replacement, to traditionally generated sources of spatial data and information in public management. It discusses the new spaces of citizen participation constructed by these geo-crowdsourcing practices.</p>","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.1130473","keywords":["Citizen participation","geo-crowdsourcing","e-government","participatory mapping","mobile applications."],"language":"eng","license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"publication_date":"2017-04-01","references":["S.

La subcuenca del r&iacute;o Cot&oacute;n cuenta con amenazas y oportunidades de conservaci&oacute;n, las cuales deben ser abordadas a trav&eacute;s de su ordenamiento territorial, entendido esto como un espacio de construcci&oacute;n social en torno a la sostenibilidad ambiental. Para el ordenamiento de este territorio, debemos conocer la riqueza biol&oacute;gica y ecosist&eacute;mica, como l&iacute;nea base para establecer y ejecutar un plan de manejo y ordenamiento de la subcuenca del r&iacute;o Cot&oacute;n. Aqu&iacute; presentamos la primera fase de la caracterizaci&oacute;n biol&oacute;gica de la subcuenca del r&iacute;o Cot&oacute;n, en la que se realiz&oacute; un trabajo de campo para obtener un inventario preliminar de anfibios, reptiles, peces, aves y mam&iacute;feros. Este inventario fue complementado con la revisi&oacute;n y organizaci&oacute;n de fuentes de informaci&oacute;n secundaria, as&iacute; como un an&aacute;lisis con Sistemas de Informaci&oacute;n Geogr&aacute;fica (SIG). Para la subcuenca del r&iacute;o Cot&oacute;n, encontramos 53 especies de anfibios, de las cuales 15 se encuentran en alguna categor&iacute;a de amenaza (Vulnerable, En Peligro y Peligro Cr&iacute;tico seg&uacute;n la IUCN) y por lo tanto tienen importancia para la conservaci&oacute;n. Para reptiles registramos 30 especies, de las cuales <em>Geophis talamancae</em> es la &uacute;nica amenazada (En Peligro), pero otras 5 especies tienen distribuci&oacute;n restringida a Costa Rica y Panam&aacute;. Para Aves se recopilaron 205 especies, de las cuales 5 son de importancia para conservaci&oacute;n por encontrarse en categor&iacute;a de Vulnerable. En cuanto a mam&iacute;feros se han registrado 41 especies, de las cuales 6 se encuentran en alguna categor&iacute;a de amenaza. Para peces pocas especies se ha evaluado su riesgo de extinci&oacute;n, pero algunas de ellas est&aacute;n restringidas a la zona pac&iacute;fico sur de Costa Rica o a Panam&aacute; y Costa Rica, por lo tanto son importantes para conservar. La riqueza biol&oacute;gica representativa de esta subcuenca cuenta con especies amenazadas, end&eacute;micas e irremplazables, que hacen de la subcuenca del r&iacute;o Cot&oacute;n, un importante &aacute;rea para la conservaci&oacute;n de la biodiversidad en Costa Rica. Amenazas como la p&eacute;rdida y degradaci&oacute;n de h&aacute;bitat, la cacer&iacute;a, contaminaci&oacute;n y potenciales proyectos hidroel&eacute;ctricos, pueden poner en peligro la supervivencia de las poblaciones de las especies que habitan la subcuenca y que son de inter&eacute;s para conservaci&oacute;n. Teniendo en cuenta que la econom&iacute;a de esta zona est&aacute; basada en la agricultura y es una zona de alto potencial tur&iacute;stico, debe darse prioridad al desarrollo en estos sectores de manera sostenible, de manera que se mitigue o elimine la deforestaci&oacute;n, contaminaci&oacute;n y cacer&iacute;a, y se eviten proyectos de infraestructura energ&eacute;tica que modifiquen las condiciones ecol&oacute;gicas de la subcuenca.</p>","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.2566686","keywords":["biodiversity","citizen science","mammals","reptiles","amphibians","fish","birds","threaten species"],"language":"spa","license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"publication_date":"2018-03-01","references":["Arrieta, O. 2010.

The largest single contributor of species observations is eBird, which so far has contributed more than 361 million records to GBIF. eBird engages a vast network of human observers (citizen-scientists) to report bird observations, with the goal of estimating the range, abundance, habitat preferences, and trends of bird species at high spatial and temporal resolutions across each species' entire life-cycle.\u00a0 Since its inception, eBird has focused on improving the data quality of its observations, primarily focused in two areas:</p>\n  \n    ensuring that participants describe how they gathered their observations and,\n    all observations are reviewed for accuracy.\n  \n  <p>In this presentation I will review how this is done in eBird.</p>\n  <p>Standardized Data Collection. eBird gathers bird observations based on how bird watchers typically observe birds with units of data collection being \"checklists\" of zero or more species including a count of individuals for each species observed.\u00a0 Participants choose the location where they made their observations and submit their checklists via Mobile Apps (50% of all submissions) or the website (50% of all submissions). All checklists are submitted in a standard format identifying where, how, and with whom they made their observations. Mobile apps precisely record locations, the track taken, and the distance they traveled while making the observations. The start time and duration of surveys are also recorded. All observers must report whether they reported all the birds they detected and identified, which allows analysts to infer absence of birds if they were not reported. All data are stored within an Oracle data management framework.</p>\n  <p>Data Accuracy. The most significant data quality challenge for species observations is detecting and correctly identifying organisms to species. The issue involves how to handle both false positives \u2014 the misidentification of an observed organism, and false negatives\u2014failing to report a species that was present. The most egregious false positives can be identified as anomalies that fall outside the norm of occurrence for a species at a particular time or space. However, false positives can also be misidentifications of common species.\u00a0 These challenges are addressed by:</p>\n  <ul>\n    Data-driven filters. \u00a0eBird's existing data can identify and flag potentially erroneous records at increasingly fine spatial, temporal, and user-specific scales. These filters can identify outliers and likely errors, which are the foundation of the eBird review process. By using the vetted data to identify outliers, data quality checks run against expected occurrence probabilities at very fine scales and identify anomalies during data submission (including on mobile devices).\n    Incorporate observer expertise scores. Observer differences are the largest source of variability in eBird data. Assessment of observer metrics, and the inclusion of these data in species distribution models, improves analysis output and model performance.\n    Expert reviewer network. More than 2000 volunteers review records identified by the data-driven filters and contact data submitters to confirm their observations. The existing data quality process functions globally. Currently the approach is focused on misidentified birds, but in the future will also involve collection event issues (e.g., issues with protocol, location, or methodology), sensitive species, exotic species, and better handle widely-observed individual rarities. Additional tools are also to be developed to help editors improve efficiency and better prioritize review.\n  </ul>\n  <p>In 2017, 4,107,757 observations representing 4.6% of all eBird records submitted were flagged for review by the data driven filters. Of these records 57.4% were validated and 42.6% were invalidated.</p>","doi":"10.3897/biss.2.25395","imprint":{"publisher":"Pensoft Publishers"},"journal":{"issue":"","pages":"e25395","title":"Biodiversity Information Science and Standards","volume":"2"},"keywords":["Data quality","observational data","eBird","citizen science"],"license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"publication_date":"2018-05-18","relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1253532"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1253531"}}]},"resource_type":{"subtype":"article","title":"Journal article","type":"publication"},"title":"An Integrated Data Quality System for Species Observations"},"owners":[1161],"revision":3,"stats":{"downloads":14.0,"unique_downloads":14.0,"unique_views":5.0,"version_downloads":14.0,"version_unique_downloads":14.0,"version_unique_views":5.0,"version_views":5.0,"version_volume":963046.0,"views":5.0,"volume":963046.0},"updated":"2019-04-09T13:46:58.947937+00:00"},{"conceptdoi":"10.5281/zenodo.1468870","conceptrecid":"1468870","created":"2018-10-22T15:49:30.426487+00:00","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.1468871","files":[{"bucket":"54d49103-7203-4570-becf-0b89c814adc9","checksum":"md5:b2aff4547d77f6f0c62a0198fcb92ff3","key":"dictator.csv","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/54d49103-7203-4570-becf-0b89c814adc9/dictator.csv"},"size":4395,"type":"csv"},{"bucket":"54d49103-7203-4570-becf-0b89c814adc9","checksum":"md5:d90c73ad80b5e5a8b107552bddbe137c","key":"QuestionsAnswersSurvey.xls","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/54d49103-7203-4570-becf-0b89c814adc9/QuestionsAnswersSurvey.xls"},"size":26112,"type":"xls"},{"bucket":"54d49103-7203-4570-becf-0b89c814adc9","checksum":"md5:b9a0f5e9b6401b81805d333c1a0d4087","key":"README.txt","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/54d49103-7203-4570-becf-0b89c814adc9/README.txt"},"size":5010,"type":"txt"},{"bucket":"54d49103-7203-4570-becf-0b89c814adc9","checksum":"md5:78473ff7c26865ae0b484d4f71c5e2d1","key":"session.csv","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/54d49103-7203-4570-becf-0b89c814adc9/session.csv"},"size":261,"type":"csv"},{"bucket":"54d49103-7203-4570-becf-0b89c814adc9","checksum":"md5:cb134a0afa1af3d23f3a797193e6ba85","key":"snowdrift.csv","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/54d49103-7203-4570-becf-0b89c814adc9/snowdrift.csv"},"size":7491,"type":"csv"},{"bucket":"54d49103-7203-4570-becf-0b89c814adc9","checksum":"md5:ce8eb8e86c629644c8432226a0114061","key":"trust.csv","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/54d49103-7203-4570-becf-0b89c814adc9/trust.csv"},"size":4699,"type":"csv"},{"bucket":"54d49103-7203-4570-becf-0b89c814adc9","checksum":"md5:f5a0d84f2993b46e9e42d19ca4afc0db","key":"users.csv","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/54d49103-7203-4570-becf-0b89c814adc9/users.csv"},"size":12997,"type":"csv"}],"id":1468871,"links":{"badge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.1468871.svg","bucket":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/54d49103-7203-4570-becf-0b89c814adc9","conceptbadge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.1468870.svg","conceptdoi":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1468870","doi":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1468871","html":"https://zenodo.org/record/1468871","latest":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/1468871","latest_html":"https://zenodo.org/record/1468871","self":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/1468871"},"metadata":{"access_right":"open","access_right_category":"success","creators":[{"affiliation":"Universitat de Barcelona","name":"Julian Vicens","orcid":"0000-0003-0643-0469"},{"affiliation":"Universitat de Barcelona","name":"Anna Cigarini"},{"affiliation":"Universitat de Barcelona","name":"Josep Perello","orcid":"0000-0001-8533-6539"}],"description":"<p><strong>STEM4Youth: Games xBadalona</strong></p>\n\n<p>Data collected during the performance STEM4Youth: Games xBadalona in Badalona on April 19th and 20th, 2017.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The participants played different dyadic behavioral games, snowdrift game, dictator&#39;s games with punishment and trust game.

The rise of large data aggregators such as GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facility), iDigBio (Integrated Digitized Biocollections), the ALA (Atlas of Living Australia) and its many clones, OBIS (Ocean Biogeographic Information System), SIBBr (Sistema de Informa\u00e7\u00e3o sobre a Biodiversidade Brasileria), CRIA (Centro de Refer\u00eancia em Informa\u00e7\u00e3o Ambiental) and many others has made access to large volumes of data easier, but choosing which data are fit for use remains a more difficult task. There has been no consistency between the various aggregators on how best to clean and document the quality \u2013 how tests are run, or how annotations are stored and reported. Feedback to data custodians on possible errors has been minimal, inconsistent, and adherence to recommendations and controlled vocabularies (where they exist) has been haphazard to say the least.</p>\n  <p>The TDWG Data Quality Interest Group is addressing these issues, either alone or in conjunction with other Interest Groups (Annotations, Darwin Core, Invasive Species, Citizen Science and Vocabulary Maintenance) to develop a framework, tests and assertions, use cases and controlled vocabularies. The Interest Group is also working closely with the data aggregators toward consistent implementations. The practical work is being done through five Task Groups. A published framework is leading to a user-friendly Fitness for Use Backbone (FFUB) and data quality profiles by which users can document the quality they need for a project. A standard set of core tests and assertions has been developed around the Darwin Core standard and are currently being tested and integrated into several aggregators. A use case library has been compiled and these cases will lead to themed data quality profiles as part of the FFUB. Two new Task Groups are being established to develop controlled vocabularies to address the inconsistencies in values of at least 40 Darwin Core terms. These inconsistencies make the evaluation of fitness for use far more difficult than achieved by using controlled vocabularies. The first TG is looking at vocabularies generally, while the second is looking at those just pertaining to Invasive Species.</p>\n  <p>It is not just the aggregators though that are the stakeholders in this work. The data custodians and even the collectors have a vested interest in ensuring their data and metadata are of highest quality and therefore seeing their data used widely.\u00a0It is only after aggregation that many uses of the data become apparent, and most collectors aren't aware of these uses at the time of collecting. Issues of data quality at the time of collection can later restrict the range of later uses of the data. \u00a0Feeding back information to the data custodians from users and aggregators on suspect records is essential, and this is where annotations and reporting back on the results of tests conducted by aggregators is important. The project is also generating standard code and test data for the tests and assertions so that data custodians can readily integrate them into their own procedures. It is far cheaper to correct errors at the source than try and rectify them further down the line.</p>\n  <p>A lot of progress has been made, but we still have a long way to go \u2013 join us in making biodiversity data quality a product of which we can all be proud.</p>","doi":"10.3897/tdwgproceedings.1.20240","imprint":{"publisher":"Pensoft Publishers"},"journal":{"issue":"","pages":"e20240","title":"Biodiversity Information Science and Standards","volume":"1"},"keywords":["TDWG BDQIG \"Data Quality\" \"Fitness for Use\" Framework \"Tests and Assertions\" quality vocabularies"],"license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"publication_date":"2017-08-14","relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1140500"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1140499"}}]},"resource_type":{"subtype":"article","title":"Journal article","type":"publication"},"title":"Fitness for Use: The BDQIG aims for improved Stability and Consistency"},"owners":[1161],"revision":4,"stats":{"downloads":13.0,"unique_downloads":13.0,"unique_views":5.0,"version_downloads":13.0,"version_unique_downloads":13.0,"version_unique_views":5.0,"version_views":5.0,"version_volume":615186.0,"views":5.0,"volume":615186.0},"updated":"2019-04-09T13:26:51.823430+00:00"},{"conceptdoi":"10.5281/zenodo.1308971","conceptrecid":"1308971","created":"2018-10-22T15:04:17.155981+00:00","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.1308972","files":[{"bucket":"ec3ed28f-dbb3-4109-ba38-62a311b4db24","checksum":"md5:e40917b0cb299c06c340913423fd92bf","key":"dictator.csv","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/ec3ed28f-dbb3-4109-ba38-62a311b4db24/dictator.csv"},"size":3452,"type":"csv"},{"bucket":"ec3ed28f-dbb3-4109-ba38-62a311b4db24","checksum":"md5:3f6a035db9f9aa891e59cb3415409de7","key":"QuestionsAnswersSurvey.xls","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/ec3ed28f-dbb3-4109-ba38-62a311b4db24/QuestionsAnswersSurvey.xls"},"size":26112,"type":"xls"},{"bucket":"ec3ed28f-dbb3-4109-ba38-62a311b4db24","checksum":"md5:8d4a49ef9762725c86206817d58396b9","key":"README.txt","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/ec3ed28f-dbb3-4109-ba38-62a311b4db24/README.txt"},"size":5001,"type":"txt"},{"bucket":"ec3ed28f-dbb3-4109-ba38-62a311b4db24","checksum":"md5:b1c2a7940d4ef4442173a23c32287310","key":"session.csv","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/ec3ed28f-dbb3-4109-ba38-62a311b4db24/session.csv"},"size":178,"type":"csv"},{"bucket":"ec3ed28f-dbb3-4109-ba38-62a311b4db24","checksum":"md5:8e84cca8d34c4d73b2b600f168c75a80","key":"snowdrift.csv","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/ec3ed28f-dbb3-4109-ba38-62a311b4db24/snowdrift.csv"},"size":5469,"type":"csv"},{"bucket":"ec3ed28f-dbb3-4109-ba38-62a311b4db24","checksum":"md5:6ec8c7d5e3286c90f422969933de4b8c","key":"trust.csv","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/ec3ed28f-dbb3-4109-ba38-62a311b4db24/trust.csv"},"size":3673,"type":"csv"},{"bucket":"ec3ed28f-dbb3-4109-ba38-62a311b4db24","checksum":"md5:15dede9e413902cbe81d1475695a3900","key":"user.csv","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/ec3ed28f-dbb3-4109-ba38-62a311b4db24/user.csv"},"size":21709,"type":"csv"}],"id":1308972,"links":{"badge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.1308972.svg","bucket":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/ec3ed28f-dbb3-4109-ba38-62a311b4db24","conceptbadge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.1308971.svg","conceptdoi":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1308971","doi":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1308972","html":"https://zenodo.org/record/1308972","latest":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/1308972","latest_html":"https://zenodo.org/record/1308972","self":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/1308972"},"metadata":{"access_right":"open","access_right_category":"success","creators":[{"affiliation":"Universitat de Barcelona","name":"Julian Vicens","orcid":"0000-0003-0643-0469"},{"affiliation":"Universitat de Barcelona","name":"Anna Cigarini"},{"affiliation":"Universitat de Barcelona","name":"Isabelle Bonhoure"},{"affiliation":"Universitat de Barcelona","name":"Josep Perello","orcid":"0000-0001-8533-6539"}],"description":"<p><strong>STEM4Youth: Games Barcelona.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Data collected during the performance STEM4Youth: Games xBarcelona in Barcelona on September 28th, 2017.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The participants played different dyadic behavioral&nbsp;games, snowdrift game, dictator&#39;s games with punishment and trust game.

increasing water demands. After years of obscurity, the science of IRES has bloomed recently and it is being recognised that IRES support a unique and high biodiversity, provide essential ecosystem services and are functionally part of river networks and groundwater systems. However, they still lack protective and adequate management, thereby jeopardizing water resources at the global scale. This Action brings together hydrologists, biogeochemists, ecologists, modellers, environmental economists, social researchers and stakeholders from 14 different countries to develop a research network for synthesising the fragmented, recent knowledge on IRES, improving our understanding of IRES and translating this into a science-based, sustainable management of river networks. Deliverables will be provided through i) research workshops synthesising and addressing key challenges in IRES science, supporting research exchange and educating young researchers, and ii) researcher-stakeholder workshops translating improved knowledge into tangible tools and guidelines for protecting IRES and raising awareness of their importance and value in societal and decision-maker spheres. This Action is organized within six Working Groups to address: (i) the occurrence, distribution and hydrological trends of IRES; (ii) the effects of flow alterations on IRES functions and services; (iii) the interaction of aquatic and terrestrial biogeochemical processes at catchment scale; (iv) the biomonitoring of the ecological status of IRES; (v) synergies in IRES research at the European scale, data assemblage and sharing; (vi) IRES management and advocacy training.</p>","doi":"10.3897/rio.3.e21774","imprint":{"publisher":"Pensoft Publishers"},"journal":{"issue":"","pages":"e21774","title":"Research Ideas and Outcomes","volume":"3"},"keywords":["Flow intermittence","river networks","water scarcity","hydrological modelling","e-flow management","ecological status assessment","climate change","conservation","management","citizen-science","Water Framework Directive."],"license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"publication_date":"2017-11-01","relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1139904"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1139903"}}]},"resource_type":{"subtype":"article","title":"Journal article","type":"publication"},"title":"Science and Management of Intermittent Rivers and Ephemeral Streams (SMIRES)"},"owners":[1161],"revision":4,"stats":{"downloads":17.0,"unique_downloads":15.0,"unique_views":5.0,"version_downloads":17.0,"version_unique_downloads":15.0,"version_unique_views":5.0,"version_views":5.0,"version_volume":16094172.0,"views":5.0,"volume":16094172.0},"updated":"2019-04-09T13:26:40.450666+00:00"},{"conceptrecid":"779405","created":"2017-05-12T08:03:04.861988+00:00","doi":"10.3897/natureconservation.6.6498","files":[{"bucket":"d23d2f30-7fd4-451c-9917-21f8b663ecd1","checksum":"md5:47a819d9d654e3c120f7d1779963ba5b","key":"NC_article_1349.pdf","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/d23d2f30-7fd4-451c-9917-21f8b663ecd1/NC_article_1349.pdf"},"size":697301,"type":"pdf"},{"bucket":"d23d2f30-7fd4-451c-9917-21f8b663ecd1","checksum":"md5:90413203a1722821fcc60d19d06da822","key":"NC_article_1349.xml","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/d23d2f30-7fd4-451c-9917-21f8b663ecd1/NC_article_1349.xml"},"size":114603,"type":"xml"}],"id":575258,"links":{"badge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.3897/natureconservation.6.6498.svg","bucket":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/d23d2f30-7fd4-451c-9917-21f8b663ecd1","doi":"https://doi.org/10.3897/natureconservation.6.6498","html":"https://zenodo.org/record/575258","latest":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/575258","latest_html":"https://zenodo.org/record/575258","self":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/575258"},"metadata":{"access_right":"open","access_right_category":"success","communities":[{"id":"biosyslit"}],"creators":[{"affiliation":"Leibniz Institute for Research on Evolution and Biodiversity, Berlin, Germany","name":"Hoffmann, Anke"},{"affiliation":"Museum f\u00fcr Naturkunde, Berlin, Germany","name":"Penner, Johannes"},{"affiliation":"MfN, Berlin, Germany","name":"Vohland, Katrin"},{"affiliation":"Aix- Marseille Universit\u00e9, unknown, France","name":"Cramer, Wolfgang"},{"affiliation":"University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom","name":"Doubleday, Robert"},{"affiliation":"Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research - UFZ, Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany","name":"Henle, Klaus"},{"affiliation":"University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia","name":"K\u00f5ljalg, Urmas"},{"affiliation":"Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research - UFZ, Halle, Germany","name":"K\u00fchn, Ingolf"},{"affiliation":"University of Leeds, Leeds, United Kingdom","name":"Kunin, William"},{"affiliation":"Estaci\u00f3n Biol\u00f3gica de Do\u00f1ana, Seville, Spain","name":"Negro, Juan Jos\u00e9"},{"affiliation":"Institute of Biodiversity & Ecosystem Research, Bulgarian\u00a0Academy\u00a0of\u00a0Sciences and Pensoft\u00a0Publishers, Sofia, Bulgaria","name":"Penev, Lyubomir"},{"affiliation":"Estaci\u00f3n Biol\u00f3gica de Do\u00f1ana, Seville, Spain","name":"Rodr\u00edguez, Carlos"},{"affiliation":"University of Eastern Finland, Joensuu, Finland","name":"Saarenmaa, Hannu"},{"affiliation":"Station d'Ecologie Experimentale du CNRS, Moulis, France","name":"Schmeller, Dirk"},{"affiliation":"National Museum of Natural History and Pensoft Publishers, Sofia, Bulgaria","name":"Stoev, Pavel"},{"affiliation":"University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom","name":"Sutherland, William"},{"affiliation":"GBIF, unknown, Denmark","name":"\u00d3 Tuama, \u00c9amonn"},{"affiliation":"Museum f\u00fcr Naturkunde - Leibniz Institute for Research on Evolution and Biodiversity, Berlin, Germany","name":"Wetzel, Florian"},{"affiliation":"Leibniz Institute for Research on Evolution and Biodiversity, Berlin, Germany","name":"H\u00e4user, Christoph L."}],"description":"<p>Biodiversity is threatened on a global scale and the losses are ongoing. In order to stop further losses and maintain important ecosystem services, programmes have been put into place to reduce and ideally halt these processes. A whole suite of different approaches is needed to meet these goals. One major scientific contribution is to collate, integrate and analyse the large amounts of fragmented and diverse biodiversity data to determine the current status and trends of biodiversity in order to inform the relevant decision makers. To contribute towards the achievement of these challenging tasks, the project EU BON was developed. The project is focusing mainly on the European continent but contributes at the same time to a much wider global initiative the Group on Earth Observations Biodiversity Observation Network (GEO BON), which itself is a part of the Group of Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS). EU BON will build on existing infrastructures such as GBIF, LifeWatch and national biodiversity data centres in Europe and will integrate relevant biodiversity data from on-ground observations to remote sensing information, covering terrestrial, freshwater and marine habitats.</p><p>A key feature of EU BON will be the delivery of relevant, fully integrated data to multiple and different stakeholders and end users ranging from local to global levels. Through development and application of new standards and protocols, EU BON will enable greater interoperability of different data layers and systems, provide access to improved analytical tools and services, and will provide better harmonized biodiversity recording and monitoring schemes from citizen science efforts to long-term research programs to mainstream future data collecting. Furthermore EU BON will support biodiversity science-policy interfaces, and facilitate political decisions for sound environmental management, also to help conserve biodiversity for human well-being at different levels, ranging from communal park management to the Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES). Additionally, the project will strengthen European capacities and infrastructures for environmental information management and sustainable development.

The Norwegian Government has funded the project with support from the Indian Government. The project has collaborated with the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) and has implemented several of the capacity building tools, standards and services offered by GBIF. In addition, WII and NHM host the national GBIF- nodes of India and Norway. Furthermore, the project is closely linked to the Indian and international strategies on biodiversity infrastructure development. The project has focused on national user needs, camera trapping techniques, data management, open access and barriers towards open access. Six case studies demonstrate how biodiversity informatics, camera trapping, data mobilization and access policies can contribute to improved decision making. This has led to a better understanding of camera trapping techniques, occupancy modelling, DNA-analysis, species distribution, human-wildlife conflicts, human disturbance effects on wild mammals, habitat recovery, tiger population management needs and investigation of tiger poaching. The project has conducted a minor data repatriation exercise at Norwegian natural history museums. The capacity-building component of this towards international legacy collections is in the description of how to mobilize data through GBIF. WII has developed a national database and a web-portal for mobilizing camera trap data. These developments are important steps towards a national, open biodiversity data management system for camera trap images and their axillary metadata. The project has developed a Best Practice Guide (BPG) for publishing of biodiversity data derived from camera trapping. This BPG will be maintained by GBIF in the future. This capacity-building pilot project has clearly proved relevance in addressing the capacity building needs identified by IPBES. As the project results show, there are many international synergies in capacity-building of biodiversity informatics, camera trapping, data mobilization, data repatriation, data management and data sharing policy improvement. Finalizing the pilot project, the project partners have decided to look for new possibilities for collaboration under the IPBES.</p>","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.999027","keywords":["biodiversity informatics","India","Norway","IPBES","GBIF","citizen science","GIS, Database","wildlife camera trapping","training","capacity building","data sharing","data repatriation","tiger","snow leopard","leopard"],"license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"notes":"DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.999027\nISSN: 1504-3312 \nISBN: 978-82-426-2698-1\nCOPYRIGHT \u00a9 Norwegian Institute for Nature Research The publication may be freely cited where the source is acknowl- edged\nAVAILABILITY [Open]\nPUBLICATION TYPE Digital document (pdf)\nEDITION 1-2012\nQUALITY","publication_date":"2014-10-01","related_identifiers":[{"identifier":"10.5281/zenodo.999026","relation":"isVersionOf","scheme":"doi"}],"relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"999027"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"999026"}}]},"resource_type":{"subtype":"report","title":"Report","type":"publication"},"title":"Capacity building for Intergovernmental Platform for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES).

For this, a method of intercalibration of the data of different missions has been designed, which has provided, as a first result and using data from the DMSP / OLS satellite, the reconstruction of the evolution of public lighting expenditure in Spain between 1992 and 2012, broken down into the different provinces. An analysis of the SNPP / VIIRS / DNB satellite images that have been applied for the determination of public lighting expenditure in the countries of the European Union and to study the variation of light pollution has been carried out as an additional validation of the method. in the municipalities of the Deltebre region. A study of the scientific use of the images taken with digital camera (DSLR) from the International Space Station (ISS) for studies of light pollution has been carried out. It is demonstrated in this work that the type of emitting spectrum of the sources of light pollution can be estimated by color-color diagrams using the three bands of the images and that it is possible to determine the type of lighting technology from the images taken from the ISS. In addition to the classification of sources using synthetic photometry, the absolute photometric calibration of the images was carried out using differential photometry of stellar fields and sources on the ground. As a first step for the scientific exploitation of the nocturnal images of the Earth that are stored in the NASA repository, a citizen science program has been created for the classification, location and geographic referencing of the images. More than 130,000 images have been classified, more than 3000 located, and more than 700 georeferenced. Other methods of capturing nighttime images of sources of light pollution have been explored, such as aerial techniques with hyperspectral and DSLR cameras, from a balloon and using drones. The radiances measured in the images obtained from the satellites have been related to the brightness of the night sky measured from the ground. To gather the necessary information, a method has been developed for the exploration of the spatial variation of the sky brightness that has been applied to the Madrid region, obtaining a map of the sky brightness in the whole region. The temporal variation has been determined with fixed stations of SQM type photometers. Finally, the spectral variation of the sky brightness was determined by continuous monitoring of the sky spectrum in Madrid with the AstMon sky-wide camera and with the SAND spectrograph. This set of measurements constitutes a fundamental data base for the application of models for the diffusion of light pollution through the atmosphere and allows us to conclude that the sky brightness is physically related to the diffuse emission observed in satellite images.</p>","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.1422725","imprint":{"isbn":"978-84-09-03071-2","place":"Madrid","publisher":"Familia S\u00e1nchez de Miguel"},"keywords":["light pollution","remote sensing"],"language":"spa","license":{"id":"CC-BY-NC-4.0"},"notes":"This is a original version","publication_date":"2015-06-15","related_identifiers":[{"identifier":"https://zenodo.org/record/1289896#.WyLj32P7RhE","relation":"isIdenticalTo","scheme":"url"},{"identifier":"10.13140/RG.2.1.2233.7127","relation":"isIdenticalTo","scheme":"doi"},{"identifier":"10.5281/zenodo.1289932","relation":"isVersionOf","scheme":"doi"}],"relations":{"version":[{"count":2,"index":1,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1422725"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1289932"}}]},"resource_type":{"subtype":"thesis","title":"Thesis","type":"publication"},"thesis":{"supervisors":[{"affiliation":"Universidad Complutense de Madrid","name":"Jaime Zamorano Calvo"},{"affiliation":"Universidad Complutense de Madrid","name":"Jesus Gallego Maestro"}],"university":"Universidad Complutense de Madrid"},"title":"Variaci\u00f3n espacial, temporal y espectral de la contaminaci\u00f3n lum\u00ednica y sus fuentes: Metodolog\u00eda y resultados","version":"1"},"owners":[20662],"revision":3,"stats":{"downloads":93.0,"unique_downloads":68.0,"unique_views":96.0,"version_downloads":216.0,"version_unique_downloads":135.0,"version_unique_views":231.0,"version_views":309.0,"version_volume":30709535028.0,"views":111.0,"volume":13225852671.0},"updated":"2019-04-09T13:58:22.055810+00:00"},{"conceptdoi":"10.5281/zenodo.3292460","conceptrecid":"3292460","created":"2019-07-10T10:39:49.442245+00:00","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.3292461","files":[{"bucket":"c1d109f6-30de-40d9-9e45-cf50a3c2f9fb","checksum":"md5:d1a9cbcde1e379a53824fb7ef94d6c5e","key":"Whitaker_IHICodingClub_July2019.pdf","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/c1d109f6-30de-40d9-9e45-cf50a3c2f9fb/Whitaker_IHICodingClub_July2019.pdf"},"size":1602421,"type":"pdf"},{"bucket":"c1d109f6-30de-40d9-9e45-cf50a3c2f9fb","checksum":"md5:5658fecf33b453e4ae662cd09f9060d3","key":"Whitaker_IHICodingClub_July2019.pptx","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/c1d109f6-30de-40d9-9e45-cf50a3c2f9fb/Whitaker_IHICodingClub_July2019.pptx"},"size":48010845,"type":"pptx"}],"id":3292461,"links":{"badge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.3292461.svg","bucket":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/c1d109f6-30de-40d9-9e45-cf50a3c2f9fb","conceptbadge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.3292460.svg","conceptdoi":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3292460","doi":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3292461","html":"https://zenodo.org/record/3292461","latest":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/3292461","latest_html":"https://zenodo.org/record/3292461","self":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/3292461"},"metadata":{"access_right":"open","access_right_category":"success","communities":[{"id":"the-turing-way"}],"creators":[{"affiliation":"The Alan Turing Institute","name":"Whitaker, Kirstie","orcid":"0000-0001-8498-4059"}],"description":"<p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Reproducible research is necessary to ensure that scientific work can be trusted. Funders and publishers are beginning to require that publications include access to the underlying data and the analysis code. The goal is to ensure that all results can be independently verified and built upon in future work. This is sometimes easier said than done! Sharing these research outputs means understanding data management, library sciences, software development, and continuous integration techniques: skills that are not widely taught or expected of academic researchers.&nbsp;<em>The Turing Way</em>&nbsp;is a handbook to support students, their supervisors, funders and journal editors in ensuring that reproducible research is &quot;too easy not to do&quot;. It includes training material on version control, analysis testing, and open and transparent communication with future users, and includes case studies and common &quot;gotchas&quot; for researchers to avoid.

It is also a prerequisite for successful participation in citizen science, open government, community development, smart healthcare, and social networks. The data revolution has similarly penetrated all areas of frontline and backroom work in libraries and turned research libraries into data-intensive organizations as a result of developments in digital scholarship, bibliometrics and altmetrics, open science, linked open data, learning analytics and data-based decision making. All library workers will increasingly need at least basic competence in dealing with data to contribute effectively in the research library of the future.</p>\n\n<p>Many research libraries have responded to the data challenge by evolving their data literacy support from helping students and faculty to find and use external social data sets to advising on management and sharing of original research data in the context of funder requirements for data management plans. A few libraries have extended the depth and breadth of their data literacy support to cover other areas and involve more library staff via data literacy training. However, our study suggests more radical change in data literacy practice is needed for research libraries to support their communities effectively in the connected data society of the 21st century.</p>\n\n<p>Our research is based on a comprehensive investigation of the impact of data on society and understandings of data literacy among different disciplines, professions, and institutions. We also explored approaches to data literacy education, including information literacy and digital skills practices that could be adopted or adapted to develop data literacy. We supplemented evidence from a variety of literature (research papers, academic textbooks, professional manuals, agency publications, popular treatments, and industry newsletters), with data from project databases and organization websites to capture current thinking and emergent practice in this fast-moving field.</p>\n\n<p>We found significant variation in how different groups and sectors define and position data literacy, which has implications for the scope and focus of library data literacy interventions. We also identified a range of stakeholders as potential collaborators for research libraries in advancing data literacy locally and globally. In addition, we found evidence of research librarians acknowledging responsibility to ensure all staff and students have the digital skills required to be successful in scholarship, employment, and lifelong learning; and another example where librarians successfully delivered an information literacy course helping students to handle information from multiple life perspectives, supporting their information needs across their academic, professional, and personal lives.</p>\n\n<p>We conclude first, that data literacy is an essential competence for all members of society; second, that existing models of data literacy education need to be extended to reflect alternative conceptions of data literacy and cover settings where people interact with data in their personal and social lives; and third, that research libraries are uniquely placed to lead the development of data literacy in society, by virtue of their expertise, structure, and relationships, but should collaborate with salient stakeholders to develop a more diverse and inclusive approach.</p>","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.3259729","license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"publication_date":"2019-06-28","related_identifiers":[{"identifier":"10.5281/zenodo.3259728","relation":"isVersionOf","scheme":"doi"}],"relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"3259729"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"3259728"}}]},"resource_type":{"title":"Presentation","type":"presentation"},"title":"The Social Mission of 21st Century Research Libraries: Building Data Literate Communities"},"owners":[45182],"revision":2,"stats":{"downloads":12.0,"unique_downloads":12.0,"unique_views":21.0,"version_downloads":12.0,"version_unique_downloads":12.0,"version_unique_views":21.0,"version_views":21.0,"version_volume":18202596.0,"views":21.0,"volume":18202596.0},"updated":"2019-06-28T19:05:45.034934+00:00"},{"conceptrecid":"3256770","created":"2019-06-26T04:31:49.625243+00:00","doi":"10.3897/biss.3.35747","files":[{"bucket":"3e9a0efb-4ec6-4a38-a937-2e5d9617b224","checksum":"md5:8a2c687e4c01f0910e47bfa0674704df","key":"BISS_article_35747.pdf","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/3e9a0efb-4ec6-4a38-a937-2e5d9617b224/BISS_article_35747.pdf"},"size":67237,"type":"pdf"},{"bucket":"3e9a0efb-4ec6-4a38-a937-2e5d9617b224","checksum":"md5:f86ae2c4ecbd13cb3f1556dc3f8dba0e","key":"BISS_article_35747.xml","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/3e9a0efb-4ec6-4a38-a937-2e5d9617b224/BISS_article_35747.xml"},"size":10816,"type":"xml"}],"id":3256771,"links":{"badge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.3897/biss.3.35747.svg","bucket":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/3e9a0efb-4ec6-4a38-a937-2e5d9617b224","doi":"https://doi.org/10.3897/biss.3.35747","html":"https://zenodo.org/record/3256771","latest":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/3256771","latest_html":"https://zenodo.org/record/3256771","self":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/3256771"},"metadata":{"access_right":"open","access_right_category":"success","communities":[{"id":"biosyslit"}],"creators":[{"affiliation":"Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU), Uppsala, Sweden|Swedish Species Information Centre (ArtDatabanken, SSIC), Uppsala, Sweden","name":"Sj\u00f6din Skarp, Liselott"}],"description":"<p>The Swedish Species Information Centre (<u>ArtDatabanken, SSIC</u>) at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (<u>SLU</u>) accumulates, analyses and disseminates information concerning Swedish species, habitats and ecosystems. The SSIC hosts the Swedish Taxonomy Initiative <u>(STI)</u> and produces <u>the Swedish Red List</u>. In addition, the SSIC is the leading partner within the Swedish LifeWatch (<u>SLW</u>) consortium, which cooperates with the Biodiversity Atlas Sweden (BAS) and the Living Atlas Community.</p>\n  <p>The SSIC provides an open access biodiversity reporting and analysis infrastructure including for example the Swedish Species Observation System (<u>artportalen.se</u>), the Swedish taxonomic backbone (<u>dyntaxa.se</u>) and tools for species information including traits, terminology and species determination (<u>artfakta.se</u>). All systems, including the SLW Analysis Portal (<u>analysisportal.se</u>), rely on recognized standards to ensure interoperability and consist of databases, API:s and portals. The Artportalen platform now contains &gt;69 000 000 georeferenced observations, along with 1 300 000 images, video or sound, of some 32 000 species from Sweden. The data are harvested by SLW and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). In addition to reports from NGOs and the general public, which generate &gt;90% of the observations, a rapidly increasing number of Swedish governmental authorities and agencies are using the platform to store regional and local species inventories collected by standardized scientific methods. There are sophisticated systems for validation and to secure data quality, and the records are used by scientists as well as by county and municipality councils as a principle biodiversity resource in environmental planning and decision making. Data concerning some species considered to be particularly sensitive to disturbance are classified and not openly available. These data can be accessed via a hierarchy of access levels so as to enable such classified data to available to, for example, environmental officers and to be used in management purposes The SSIC has just launched new API:s, modules for improved reporting of species checklists and invasive species, and a new platform aggregating the services in a single web interface and based on responsive design and specific interfaces for different users (<u>artfakta.se</u>). Improvements are also to be made in the infrastructure of the Swedish taxonomic backbone, which now contains data for almost all Swedish species (more than 275 000 scientific names and 62 000 species). </p>\n  <p>In 2002, when the Swedish Taxonomy Initiative (STI) was established, the SSIC was commissioned by the Swedish Parliament to identify all species of multicellular plants, fungi and animals in the country and to make the information available to scientists, conservationists and the public. The information is presented in the Artfakta platform and in a series of identification handbooks, The Encyclopedia of the Swedish Flora and Fauna. In addition, the STI supports barcoding activities, scientific courses and announces grants for museums and taxonomic research and inventories within poorly known organismal groups. The Swedish and Norwegian taxonomy initiatives work cooperatively to increase the collective knowledge of poorly known species and, as a result, more than 3 000 species new to Sweden and Norway have been found, approximately a third being new to science. The attempt to join forces between different Scandinavian counterparts via technical progress and to focus on digitalization and sharing information on species and communities from the same biogeographical region has proven a successful concept.</p>","doi":"10.3897/biss.3.35747","imprint":{"publisher":"Pensoft Publishers"},"journal":{"issue":"","pages":"e35747","title":"Biodiversity Information Science and Standards","volume":"3"},"keywords":["Biodiversity infrastructure","taxonomy","species information","determination keys","Citizen Science"],"license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"publication_date":"2019-06-18","relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"3256771"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"3256770"}}]},"resource_type":{"subtype":"article","title":"Journal article","type":"publication"},"title":"The Swedish Taxonomy Initative & Biodiversity Infrastructure"},"owners":[1161],"revision":2,"stats":{"downloads":3.0,"unique_downloads":3.0,"unique_views":3.0,"version_downloads":3.0,"version_unique_downloads":3.0,"version_unique_views":3.0,"version_views":3.0,"version_volume":201711.0,"views":3.0,"volume":201711.0},"updated":"2019-06-26T07:05:45.426443+00:00"},{"conceptrecid":"3256788","created":"2019-06-26T04:32:29.009959+00:00","doi":"10.3897/biss.3.36614","files":[{"bucket":"0e76660e-3571-4b8f-aec5-2492448048db","checksum":"md5:b1404519e15721f0ad47f156fc9c4212","key":"BISS_article_36614.pdf","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/0e76660e-3571-4b8f-aec5-2492448048db/BISS_article_36614.pdf"},"size":63691,"type":"pdf"},{"bucket":"0e76660e-3571-4b8f-aec5-2492448048db","checksum":"md5:422d961a80ccdcf28c74b6e4219d1361","key":"BISS_article_36614.xml","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/0e76660e-3571-4b8f-aec5-2492448048db/BISS_article_36614.xml"},"size":10741,"type":"xml"}],"id":3256789,"links":{"badge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.3897/biss.3.36614.svg","bucket":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/0e76660e-3571-4b8f-aec5-2492448048db","doi":"https://doi.org/10.3897/biss.3.36614","html":"https://zenodo.org/record/3256789","latest":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/3256789","latest_html":"https://zenodo.org/record/3256789","self":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/3256789"},"metadata":{"access_right":"open","access_right_category":"success","communities":[{"id":"biosyslit"}],"creators":[{"name":"Kalyakin, Mikhail"},{"affiliation":"Zoological museum of Lomonosov Moscow State University, Moscow, Russia","name":"Tomkovich, Pavel"},{"affiliation":"Zoological museum of Lomonosov Moscow State University, Moscow, Russia","name":"Koblik, Eugeny"},{"affiliation":"Zoological museum of Lomonosov Moscow State University, Moscow, Russia","name":"Red'kin, Yaroslav"},{"affiliation":"Zoological museum of Lomonosov Moscow State University, Moscow, Russia","name":"Voltzit, Olga"}],"description":"<p>Biological diversity (BD), or diversity of all living organisms and levels of their organization, represents one of the most important natural resources of the country. As with other resources, BD assets and issues need\u00a0documentation and\u00a0tracking: it is impossible to protect and manage BD resources without such accounting. We recognize the need is critical for a sophisticated system to store, synthesize, use, and share BD data. Accepting and understanding this need is illustrated by the second Global Biodiversity Informatics Conference (GBIC2)\u00a0in 2018 Digital documentation of the BD state is not properly established in the Russian Federation, and a scientific analysis of the basics of monitoring of natural resources and their management have been missing.</p>\n  <p>Contstruction of a comprehensive BD\u00a0database is an obvious step for biologists. This presentation will cover our view of\u00a0a practical way to develop of scientific principles and to create an adequate system to documentthe monitoring of biological diversity within the Russian Federation. Digitization and documentation of collections has just begun in the Zoological Museum of Lomonosov Moscow State University, starting with birds. Using thisthis model group, plans are to develop scientific approaches to identify the most important parameters, the analysis and monitoring of which can provide effective knowledge about the composition, spatial distribution, temporal dynamics of the composition, and abundance of this animal group within the country. Once developed, such a system and schema of a monitoring of biological resources can be further transferred with necessary adjustments to other groups of living organisms as well as recommended for use in practical purposes (e.g., conservation, augmentation, efficient use) by the relevant state services.</p>\n  <p>For the first time, we will carry out a comprehensive analysis of the\u00a0bird data\u00a0available to Russian scientists from\u00a0one of the largest Northern Eurasian collections from Lomonosov Moscow State University and Zoological Institute of Russian Academy of Sciences, St.Petersburg, reflecting composition, variation and historical dynamics of the spatial distribution of birds inRussia\u00a0territories\u00a0and adjacent regions over more than two centuries. The project will analyze biomaterial collections for genetic studies, existing collections\u00a0databases and those under development for\u00a0faunistics, bioacoustics, literature, and field accounts of Russian ornithological resources. We will parameterize taxonomic composition of a model group, including the presence and levels of intraspecific genetic, morphological and ecological diversity; the spatial distribution of species and subspecies; species and subspecies abundance in different parts of the country; the temporal dynamics of composition, abundance and spatial distribution of birds; main biological peculiarities of species\u00a0traits;\u00a0key\u00a0practical, scientific, educational,\u00a0and\u00a0conservation uses of specific species;\u00a0and\u00a0their roles in\u00a0the\u00a0ecosystems.</p>\n  <p>We will participate in\u00a0the\u00a0organization and support of several databases, atlas projects, monitoring schemes, coordination of citizen science programs and long-time works with foreign colleagues in\u00a0the\u00a0European Bird Census Council (https://www.ebcc.info) and several international working groups (e.g. https://www.waderstudygroup.org).

Under the supervision&nbsp;of biologists from NRDI GeoEcoMar, in collaboration with the PhD students from Belgium involved in the PRIDE project, a series of interactive and proactive&nbsp;activities were accomplished, aiming at foster a sense of community and environmental responsibility to the young generation. In total, 30 students of 5th&nbsp;grade, with ages between 11 and 12 years were involved. The children from &ldquo;Ciprian Porumbescu&rdquo; School learned how to identify species belonging to the&nbsp;Ponto-Caspian relicts, recognize and understand the negative impact of the invasive species on the Black Sea biodiversity. The children from Mihail Koiciu&nbsp;School, who visited the R/V Mare Nigrum (in custody of the NRDI GeoEcoMar) guided by the ship&rsquo;s commander and biologists from GeoEcoMar, explored&nbsp;the complicated but interesting domain of marine science, helped by explanations and demonstrations on research work in biology and geochemistry.

Yet, the tools for exploring and discovering scientific content are often lacking. With traditional, list-based search engines, users have to examine articles and their relationships by hand, which is a time-consuming process.</p>\n\n<p>Open Knowledge Maps is an attempt to transform discovery of scientific knowledge by providing an open, community-driven non-profit system that leverages the digital open science ecosystem. Instead of lists, we propose to use knowledge maps for discovery. Knowledge maps provide an instant overview of a field by showing the main areas of the field at a glance, and papers related to each area. This makes it possible to easily identify useful, pertinent information.</p>\n\n<p>Our goal is to provide a large-scale system of open, interactive and interlinked knowledge maps for every research topic, every field and every discipline. This system will enable people inside and outside of academia to not only get an overview of a field and identify relevant concepts, but also to discover trends, recognize important researchers, and to understand connections between fields.</p>\n\n<p>On our website https://openknowledgemaps.org, users can currently create a knowledge map for a topic of their choice based on either BASE or PubMed. Our software retrieves the 100 most relevant results for a topic and generates a knowledge map based on textual similarity between the records. The map is intended to give users a head start in their literature research.</p>\n\n<p>With this service, we have created a lot of enthusiasm in the community. Our user base has quickly grown: since our launch in May 2016, we have recorded over half a million visits to the site and more than 120,000 maps have been created. Open Knowledge Maps has become an international collaboration with team members, advisors and partners from variety of fields, including research, librarianship, design, software development, citizen science, and the open knowledge and open science movement.</p>\n\n<p>In the future, we want to turn discovery into an open and collaborative process. Most people are currently tackling discovery on their own &ndash; and therefore repeat the same process over and over again. By sharing the results of our discoveries, we can save valuable time and build on top of each other&rsquo;s knowledge; for example, researchers and medical librarians can collaboratively map the newest research on a certain disease and openly share result of their efforts for the benefit of evidence-based practice and patients affected by this disease.</p>\n\n<p>We see research libraries and librarians as central to this vision. The complex collaborative system outlined above cannot be realized without experts on knowledge stewardship and community engagement. Together with the other stakeholders from research and society, including researchers, students, journalists, citizen scientists and many more, we want to create system that enables us to create pathways through science for each other. So that we can all benefit from this unique knowledge.</p>","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.3258106","license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"publication_date":"2019-06-27","related_identifiers":[{"identifier":"10.5281/zenodo.3258105","relation":"isVersionOf","scheme":"doi"}],"relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"3258106"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"3258105"}}]},"resource_type":{"title":"Presentation","type":"presentation"},"title":"Open Knowledge Maps: a Visual Interface to the World's Scientific Knowledge"},"owners":[45182],"revision":2,"stats":{"downloads":58.0,"unique_downloads":52.0,"unique_views":120.0,"version_downloads":58.0,"version_unique_downloads":52.0,"version_unique_views":119.0,"version_views":132.0,"version_volume":211750286.0,"views":133.0,"volume":211750286.0},"updated":"2019-06-27T19:05:45.419097+00:00"}],"total":651},"links":{"next":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/?sort=bestmatch&q=%22open+hardware%22+%22citizen+science%22&page=4&size=200","prev":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/?sort=bestmatch&q=%22open+hardware%22+%22citizen+science%22&page=2&size=200","self":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/?sort=bestmatch&q=%22open+hardware%22+%22citizen+science%22&page=3&size=200"}}
