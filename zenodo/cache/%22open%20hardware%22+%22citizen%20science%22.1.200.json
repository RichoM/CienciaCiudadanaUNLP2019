Still, the recent increase in scale, scope, diversity and number of citizen science projects highlights the challenge of designing and implementing good practices around data collection and data curation. The Committee on Data for Science and Technology of the International Council for Science (ICSU-CODATA) and the World Data System (WDS) recently founded a joint Task Group to understand and support good practices for citizen science data validation, data cleaning and curation, and, short- and long- term data management.</p>\n  <p>Research projects conducted by the ICSU-CODATA-WDS Task Group include the development of an initial typology of citizen science data generating tasks, and an exploratory landscape analysis of the state of the data in citizen science. The landscape analysis found that citizen science projects\u00a0use a wide\u00a0range of strategies for data validation at numerous stages of the\u00a0scientific research process. In comparison, practices for data documentation, curation, and long-term management are less advanced. This may limit data discovery and re-use.</p>\n  <p>This work compliments the planned and ongoing efforts of the TDWG Citizen Science Interest Group to advance biodiversity informatics for citizen science. Presenting research on the state of the data in citizen science can promote cross-pollination between the ICSU-CODATA-WDS Task Group and the biodiversity community, and encourage researchers and practitioners to work together to advance citizen science data quality, standards, and interoperability.</p>","doi":"10.3897/tdwgproceedings.1.20370","imprint":{"publisher":"Pensoft Publishers"},"journal":{"issue":"","pages":"e20370","title":"Biodiversity Information Science and Standards","volume":"1"},"keywords":["Citizen science","crowdsourcing","data quality","data validation","data curation","data management","converging communities"],"license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"publication_date":"2017-08-18","relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1140599"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1140598"}}]},"resource_type":{"subtype":"article","title":"Journal article","type":"publication"},"title":"The state of the data in citizen science"},"owners":[1161],"revision":4,"stats":{"downloads":16.0,"unique_downloads":16.0,"unique_views":8.0,"version_downloads":16.0,"version_unique_downloads":16.0,"version_unique_views":8.0,"version_views":8.0,"version_volume":785120.0,"views":8.0,"volume":785120.0},"updated":"2019-04-09T13:26:54.300553+00:00"},{"conceptdoi":"10.5281/zenodo.1217911","conceptrecid":"1217911","created":"2018-04-13T11:43:06.308201+00:00","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.1217912","files":[{"bucket":"5bb37dc6-a52a-431f-abc3-c9f65c0a912b","checksum":"md5:9ee13a53b56411ba0730c3e4ddc50338","key":"EGU2018-17461_pico_nuest_bartoschek.pdf","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/5bb37dc6-a52a-431f-abc3-c9f65c0a912b/EGU2018-17461_pico_nuest_bartoschek.pdf"},"size":2244513,"type":"pdf"}],"id":1217912,"links":{"badge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.1217912.svg","bucket":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/5bb37dc6-a52a-431f-abc3-c9f65c0a912b","conceptbadge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.1217911.svg","conceptdoi":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1217911","doi":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1217912","html":"https://zenodo.org/record/1217912","latest":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/1217912","latest_html":"https://zenodo.org/record/1217912","self":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/1217912"},"metadata":{"access_right":"open","access_right_category":"success","creators":[{"affiliation":"Institute for Geoinformatics, University of M\u00fcnster","name":"N\u00fcst, Daniel","orcid":"0000-0002-0024-5046"},{"affiliation":"Institute for Geoinformatics, University of M\u00fcnster","name":"Bartoschek, Thomas","orcid":"0000-0002-0882-1036"}],"description":"<p>Open Science is a major movement in openness, availability, and transparency spanning Open Access, Open Data, Reproducible Research, Free and Open Source Software (FOSS), and Open-source Hardware.

In two workshops, citizen science practitioners with experience in mobile application and web-platform development and implementation came together to analyse, discuss and define recommendations for the initiators of technology based citizen science projects.

Mit diesem Bericht m&ouml;chten wir einen weiteren Schritt in Richtung Transparenz gehen und somit den Dialog zwischen Wissenschaft und Gesellschaft in &Ouml;sterreich f&ouml;rdern.</p>\n\n<p>Mit der Gr&uuml;ndung im M&auml;rz 2014 als erstes Netzwerk f&uuml;r Citizen Science Projekte in &Ouml;sterreich und vermutlich auch Europas, wurde eine auch international beachtete Erfolgsgeschichte gestartet. Zahlreiche weitere nationale und internationale Citizen Science Plattformen, die nach <em>&Ouml;sterreich forscht</em> gegr&uuml;ndet wurden, wie z.B. <a href=\"http://www.buergerschaffenwissen.de/\">B&uuml;rger schaffen Wissen</a>, <a href=\"http://www.schweiz-forscht.ch/de/\">Schweiz forscht</a> oder auch das <a href=\"https://www.zentrumfuercitizenscience.at/\">Zentrum f&uuml;r Citizen Science</a> angesiedelt im OeAD, haben ebenfalls das Potential von Citizen Science erkannt. Einladungen zu internationalen Konferenzen als Best practice-Beispiel, das enorme Wachstum von <em>&Ouml;sterreich forscht</em> seit der Gr&uuml;ndung und nicht zuletzt auch das steigende Interesse an der &Ouml;sterreichischen Citizen Science Konferenz,&nbsp; der einzigen deutschsprachigen Citizen Science Konferenz, belegen diesen Erfolg.

In two workshops, citizen science practitioners with experience in mobile application and web-platform development and implementation came together to analyse, discuss and define recommendations for the initiators of technology based citizen science projects.

Citizen science goals include enhancing scientific knowledge generation, contributing to societally relevant questions, fostering scientific literacy in society and transforming science communication. These aims, however, are rarely evaluated, and project managers as well as prospective funders are often at a loss when it comes to assessing and reviewing the quality and impact of citizen science activities. To ensure and improve the quality of citizen science outcomes evaluation methods are required for planning, self-evaluation and training development as well as for informing funding reviews and impact assessments. Here, based on an in-depth review of the characteristics and diversity of citizen science activities and current evaluation practices, we develop an open framework for evaluating diverse citizen science activities, ranging from projects initiated by grassroots initiatives to those led by academic scientists.\u00a0 The framework incorporates the social, the scientific and the socio-ecological/economic perspectives of citizen science and thus offers a comprehensive collection of indicators at a glance. Indicators on a process- and impact-level can be selected and prioritized from all three perspectives, according to the specific contexts and targets. The framework guides and fosters the critical assessment and enhancement of citizen science projects against these goals both for external funding reviews as well as for internal project development.</p>","doi":"10.17605/OSF.IO/ENZC9","grants":[{"acronym":"CAPTOR","code":"688110","funder":{"acronyms":["EC"],"doi":"10.13039/501100000780","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/funders/10.13039/501100000780"},"name":"European Commission"},"links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/grants/10.13039/501100000780::688110"},"program":"H2020","title":"Collective Awareness Platform for Tropospheric Ozone Pollution"}],"keywords":["Citizen Science","Open Science","Participatory Science","Evaluation","impact assessment","public participation"],"license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"publication_date":"2017-09-20","related_identifiers":[{"identifier":"osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/enzc9","relation":"isIdenticalTo","scheme":"handle"}],"relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"897919"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"897918"}}]},"resource_type":{"subtype":"article","title":"Journal article","type":"publication"},"title":"The Challenge of Evaluation: An Open Framework for Evaluating Citizen Science Activities"},"owners":[36254],"revision":8,"stats":{"downloads":61.0,"unique_downloads":54.0,"unique_views":158.0,"version_downloads":61.0,"version_unique_downloads":54.0,"version_unique_views":157.0,"version_views":157.0,"version_volume":25656478.0,"views":158.0,"volume":25656478.0},"updated":"2019-04-10T04:22:04.329941+00:00"},{"conceptrecid":"802702","created":"2017-06-05T00:35:10.690508+00:00","doi":"10.13140/RG.2.2.26003.07206","files":[{"bucket":"964bd6cc-deed-4766-a73b-fbbf79cb2497","checksum":"md5:5a8471cb16fe9bd348a725009e142d15","key":"Shark Citizen Science.pdf","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/964bd6cc-deed-4766-a73b-fbbf79cb2497/Shark%20Citizen%20Science.pdf"},"size":324749,"type":"pdf"}],"id":802703,"links":{"badge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.13140/RG.2.2.26003.07206.svg","bucket":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/964bd6cc-deed-4766-a73b-fbbf79cb2497","doi":"https://doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.26003.07206","html":"https://zenodo.org/record/802703","latest":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/802703","latest_html":"https://zenodo.org/record/802703","self":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/802703"},"metadata":{"access_right":"open","access_right_category":"success","communities":[{"id":"citizenscience"}],"creators":[{"affiliation":"Ocean Sanctuaries","name":"Bear, Michael"}],"description":"<p>Traditionally, academic science has used graduate students to collect data in many cases, but community science, the term by which\u00a0citizen science\u00a0is also known, has revolutionized the process by which large amounts of data can be collected accurately by large numbers of non-scientists under the training and mentorship of scientists.

For the many fields of marine research, this is a particularly powerful approach which should not be overlooked. The sheer scale of coastal and ocean environments mean that it would take several lifetimes for scientists to study them alone. By collaborating with citizens, a much greater number of people can be mobilized to gather a wealth of data and develop new scientific knowledge and understanding. The variety of data types which are amenable to Citizen Science, as outlined in the position paper, are great, meaning that there could be a project to suit everyone. Citizen Science can also enable participants to improve their Ocean Literacy, gain new skills and experiences, and can also empower them to participate in the process of delivering future marine policy.</p>\n\n<p>Now, more than ever, marine science research is needed to understand the impacts of a world undergoing change. The rise of Marine Citizen Science to help address this need is therefore timely. This paper highlights opportunities, challenges and best practice in Marine Citizen Science, and sets out a list of high-level strategic recommendations for the future development of Marine Citizen Science in Europe. It presents examples of existing Marine Citizen Science initiatives in Europe to illustrate good practice. Common concerns such as data quality and maintaining engagement are discussed, as are future opportunities such as increased use of technology and potential role of Marine Citizen Science in informing marine policy and conservation. The paper closes with a list of high-level strategic recommendations for the future development of Marine Citizen Science in Europe.</p>","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.3338094","language":"eng","license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"publication_date":"2017-05-18","related_identifiers":[{"identifier":"10.5281/zenodo.3338093","relation":"isVersionOf","scheme":"doi"}],"relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"3338094"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"3338093"}}]},"resource_type":{"subtype":"report","title":"Report","type":"publication"},"title":"Advancing Citizen Science for Coastal and Ocean Research"},"owners":[63383],"revision":3,"stats":{"downloads":10.0,"unique_downloads":6.0,"unique_views":4.0,"version_downloads":10.0,"version_unique_downloads":6.0,"version_unique_views":4.0,"version_views":6.0,"version_volume":27104130.0,"views":6.0,"volume":27104130.0},"updated":"2019-07-16T19:05:49.690335+00:00"},{"conceptrecid":"1115663","created":"2017-12-13T21:08:48.956889+00:00","doi":"10.3897/BDJ.5.e21271","files":[{"bucket":"c1e4a6a5-a077-4732-b7ff-b12888716e8b","checksum":"md5:5003e3d04f56603cfbc680ffd1988094","key":"BDJ_article_21271.pdf","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/c1e4a6a5-a077-4732-b7ff-b12888716e8b/BDJ_article_21271.pdf"},"size":120728,"type":"pdf"},{"bucket":"c1e4a6a5-a077-4732-b7ff-b12888716e8b","checksum":"md5:1f9e72545639e4803176ea73eca59bf0","key":"BDJ_article_21271.xml","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/c1e4a6a5-a077-4732-b7ff-b12888716e8b/BDJ_article_21271.xml"},"size":39707,"type":"xml"}],"id":1115664,"links":{"badge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.3897/BDJ.5.e21271.svg","bucket":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/c1e4a6a5-a077-4732-b7ff-b12888716e8b","doi":"https://doi.org/10.3897/BDJ.5.e21271","html":"https://zenodo.org/record/1115664","latest":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/1115664","latest_html":"https://zenodo.org/record/1115664","self":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/1115664"},"metadata":{"access_right":"open","access_right_category":"success","communities":[{"id":"biosyslit"}],"creators":[{"affiliation":"Institute for Agro-Environmental Sciences, NARO, Tsukuba, Japan","name":"Osawa, Takeshi"},{"affiliation":"Institute for Agro-Environmental Sciences, NARO, Tsukuba, Japan","name":"Yamanaka, Takehiko"},{"affiliation":"Institute for Agro-Environmental Sciences, NARO, Tsukuba, Japan","name":"Nakatani, Yukinobu"},{"affiliation":"Faculty of Science, Toho University, Funabashi, Japan","name":"Nishihiro, Jun"},{"affiliation":"Faculty of Science, Toho University, Funabashi, Japan","name":"Takahashi, Shiori"},{"affiliation":"Iwate Prefetural Museum, Morioka, Japan","name":"Mahoro, Suzuki"},{"affiliation":"Sumisaka Junior High School, Sumisaka, Japan","name":"Sasaki, Hironobu"}],"description":"<p>Scientific field observation by members of the public is known as citizen science and has become popular all across the world. Citizen science is advantageous for collecting large amounts of scientific data and can be seen as a crowdsourcing approach to data collection. Information and communications technology is enhancing the availability of citizen science. Mobile devices, such as mobile phones, that have a digital camera with a global positioning system (GPS) are necessities for contemporary life and can be utilised as powerful observation tools in citizen science.</p>\n\n  <p>A\u00a0 web-based system\u00a0has been developed\u00a0as a data collection tool for citizen science. Participants submit an e-mail with a photo taken by their mobile phones. The photos contain location information, which can be easily and automatically embedded if the mobile phone is equipped with GPS. Collaboration has been undertaken with regional event managers, such as museum curators and held citizen science events in each region and for various target taxonomic groups. All photos were stored in the data server and the organisms were taxonomically identified by citizen scientists, regional managers and the authors. In total, 154 species and 843 data records were collected in this project conducted from 2011 to 2016.</p>","doi":"10.3897/BDJ.5.e21271","imprint":{"publisher":"Pensoft Publishers"},"journal":{"issue":"","pages":"e21271","title":"Biodiversity Data Journal","volume":"5"},"keywords":["Citizen science; Mobile phone; Social networking system; Open data"],"license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"publication_date":"2017-11-06","relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1115664"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1115663"}}]},"resource_type":{"subtype":"article","title":"Journal article","type":"publication"},"title":"A crowdsourcing approach to collecting photo-based insect and plant observation records"},"owners":[1161],"revision":4,"stats":{"downloads":2.0,"unique_downloads":2.0,"unique_views":3.0,"version_downloads":2.0,"version_unique_downloads":2.0,"version_unique_views":3.0,"version_views":3.0,"version_volume":241456.0,"views":3.0,"volume":241456.0},"updated":"2019-02-18T20:14:29.346995+00:00"},{"conceptrecid":"980828","created":"2017-09-23T21:46:03.523501+00:00","doi":"10.3897/rio.2.e8616.figure2","files":[{"bucket":"c99d60d7-5265-4d9b-8fd7-a973a412bbe7","checksum":"md5:0779c125546f2e77d688e7f3a01ac13c","key":"oo_81239.png","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/c99d60d7-5265-4d9b-8fd7-a973a412bbe7/oo_81239.png"},"size":2588220,"type":"png"}],"id":980829,"links":{"badge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.3897/rio.2.e8616.figure2.svg","bucket":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/c99d60d7-5265-4d9b-8fd7-a973a412bbe7","doi":"https://doi.org/10.3897/rio.2.e8616.figure2","html":"https://zenodo.org/record/980829","latest":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/980829","latest_html":"https://zenodo.org/record/980829","self":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/980829","thumb250":"https://zenodo.org/api/iiif/v2/c99d60d7-5265-4d9b-8fd7-a973a412bbe7:4b9e38d0-3ab1-4023-86f3-874a1bc56e3c:oo_81239.png/full/250,/0/default.png"},"metadata":{"access_right":"open","access_right_category":"success","creators":[{"affiliation":"Museum fuer Naturkunde, Leibniz Institute for Research on Evolution and Biodiversity, Invalidenstr. 43, 10115 Berlin, Germany","name":"Vohland, Katrin"},{"affiliation":"Museum fuer Naturkunde, Leibniz Institute for Research on Evolution and Biodiversity, Invalidenstr. 43, 10115 Berlin, Germany","name":"H\u00e4user, Christoph"},{"affiliation":"United Nations Environment Programme World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP-WCMC), 219 Huntingdon Road, Cambridge, CB3 0DL, United Kingdom","name":"Regan, Eugenie"},{"affiliation":"Museum fuer Naturkunde, Leibniz Institute for Research on Evolution and Biodiversity, Invalidenstr. 43, 10115 Berlin, Germany","name":"Hoffmann, Anke"},{"affiliation":"Museum fuer Naturkunde, Leibniz Institute for Research on Evolution and Biodiversity, Invalidenstr. 43, 10115 Berlin, Germany","name":"Wetzel, Florian"}],"description":"Figure 2 - \n        Setting the scene for the roundtable on Citizen Science (credits: Carola Radtke).","doi":"10.3897/rio.2.e8616.figure2","keywords":["Citizen Science","biodiversity data","data quality","Biodiversity Observation Networks","EU BON","research data","European Citizen Science Association","Citizen Science Observatories."],"license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"publication_date":"2016-03-24","related_identifiers":[{"identifier":"10.3897/rio.2.e8616","relation":"isPartOf","scheme":"doi"}],"relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"980829"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"980828"}}]},"resource_type":{"subtype":"figure","title":"Figure","type":"image"},"title":"Figure 2 from: Vohland K, H\u00e4user C, Regan E, Hoffmann A, Wetzel F (2016) 2nd EU BON Stakeholder Roundtable (Berlin, Germany): How can a European biodiversity network support citizen science?

Volunteer participants provide experimental data conforming new tools for researchers, they raise new questions and co-create a new scientific culture. While citizens add value to researchers, they acquire new skills and a deeper understanding of scientific work in an appealing and direct way. As a result of this open, networked and transdisciplinary scenario, science-society-policy interactions are improved, leveraging more democratic research based on evidence and informed decision-making. These results of the open engagement must also be understood in terms of technological innovation, social inclusion and optimization of resources, with a great potential for scientific excellence using larger data sources and collective intelligence. In summary, the collective creativity and the potential of scientific innovation are enriched by the greater number and variety of collaborators and the values of responsible research are adopted.</em></p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><em>Citizen science is growing in number of experiments, in range of themes and increasingly nature of participants. Spain occupies a prominent place in Europe and in the world in the ranking of publications as well as international projects and initiatives. This document presents a report on the activities of promotion and analysis of citizen science in our country, seeking to increase our knowledge and vision on citizen science. It seeks to lay the foundations of a long-term work to first understand how citizen science is changing the relationship between science and society, and secondly provoking change thanks to the inclusion of new actors and new practices of open participation . In other words, the project seeks to understand the impact of Citizen Science on Spanish scientific culture. To achieve this, the Observatory has identified a significant number of actors (research groups, funding programs, citizens' initiatives, physical spaces, NGOs ...),\u00a0 it has analyzed major trends and best practices, and collected tools for long term monitoring of citizen science in Spain.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>We can summarize that Spain has a growing number of projects and actors listed as citizen science. This number is higher than what we find in most European countries. Its impacts are both scientific, social and educational. The use of citizen science and its study is found in publications, with an increasing evolution around several disciplines, especially biodiversity and environmental monitoring. But the impact of science is also noticeable in practice outside academia, including social networks.</em></p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><em>The Observatory of Citizen Science in Spain has served to promote and foster coordination between citizen science in our country. We have developed face-to-face events with more than 100 cases between workshops and presentations, including citizen scientists.

Citizen science offers important benefits to science and society. For example, citizens can help scientists with data collection and provide advice on research design and implementation. Citizens can also gain a better understanding of scientific concepts and methods. Additionally, citizens can help scientists better understand and address issues of concern to their families and communities. However, citizen science also raises ethical issues that should be addressed when projects begin and throughout the course of scientific investigation. To promote ethical research, scientists should develop guidelines for involvement of citizens in research, communicate effectively with participants and local communities at the outset of their involvement in research projects, carefully oversee their work, develop appropriate publication practices, and provide lay-volunteers with education and training on the responsible conduct of research. Researchers also need to be cognizant of clarifying these roles and responsibilities as well as promoting appropriate and safe citizen participation and transparency of the study methods, data analysis, and communication of results.","doi":"10.1016/j.envsci.2015.05.008","license":{"id":"CC0-1.0"},"publication_date":"2015-06-06","relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1258927"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1258926"}}]},"resource_type":{"subtype":"article","title":"Journal article","type":"publication"},"title":"A framework for addressing ethical issues in citizen science"},"owners":[13380],"revision":3,"stats":{"downloads":51.0,"unique_downloads":47.0,"unique_views":21.0,"version_downloads":51.0,"version_unique_downloads":47.0,"version_unique_views":21.0,"version_views":21.0,"version_volume":21653223.0,"views":21.0,"volume":21653223.0},"updated":"2019-04-09T13:48:10.926600+00:00"},{"conceptdoi":"10.5281/zenodo.1479272","conceptrecid":"1479272","created":"2018-11-07T11:24:51.427775+00:00","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.1479273","files":[{"bucket":"f1467eb6-0427-47f8-86b4-c09a31e54530","checksum":"md5:3702ef30eb8dfa791e027679f598be2d","key":"Mayer_Kieslinger_Schaefer_2018.pdf","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/f1467eb6-0427-47f8-86b4-c09a31e54530/Mayer_Kieslinger_Schaefer_2018.pdf"},"size":243504,"type":"pdf"}],"id":1479273,"links":{"badge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.1479273.svg","bucket":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/f1467eb6-0427-47f8-86b4-c09a31e54530","conceptbadge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.1479272.svg","conceptdoi":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1479272","doi":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1479273","html":"https://zenodo.org/record/1479273","latest":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/1479273","latest_html":"https://zenodo.org/record/1479273","self":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/1479273"},"metadata":{"access_right":"open","access_right_category":"success","communities":[{"id":"citizenscience"}],"creators":[{"affiliation":"ZSI Centre for Social Innovation","name":"Mayer, Katja","orcid":"0000-0003-1184-595X"},{"affiliation":"ZSI Centre for Social Innovation","name":"Kieslinger, Barbara","orcid":"0000-0002-0671-1917"},{"affiliation":"ZSI Centre for Social Innovation","name":"Sch\u00e4fer, Teresa"}],"description":"<p>How can we best combine citizen science and participatory social research to produce benefits for involved citizens and communities, researchers, and society at large?

While citizen science is well known\u00a0for supporting biodiversity research and monitoring at national and global scales, many projects also engage the public in areas including local environmental monitoring and participatory health research. Beyond data collection, volunteers increasingly participate in all stages of the scientific research process, including data analysis and project or protocol design.\u00a0</p>\n  <p>The use of standards can help scientists and volunteers collect, exchange, and understand information within and beyond the initial data collection context. But the state of data standardization and interoperability in citizen science is currently limited. Not all projects wish to collect standardized data or make their data open for re-use. Further, diverse stakeholders\u00a0including community members, regulatory agencies, and research scientists, may disagree about what types of information are relevant and\u00a0what formats information should take\u00a0Gobel et al. 2017. And while citizen science is valued as a method that can help address complex global problems, integrating a range of interdisciplinary data from diverse sources, as required by\u00a0projects like Global Mosquito Alert Bowser et al. 2017, can be\u00a0a formidable technical challenge.\u00a0</p>\n  <p>In 2015, a consortium of individuals dedicated to understanding and addressing these challenges was formalized through the Data and Metadata Working Group of the Citizen Science Association (CSA). The Working Group is making progress on a number of challenges, including developing\u00a0an evolving data and metadata standard and ontology called Public Participation in Scientific Research CORE, or PPSR_CORE Cavalier et al. 2015.\u00a0To be effective and impactful, PPSR_CORE will need to be compatible with existing standards like Darwin Core, and also develop a shared vocabulary for documenting important aspects of participation like data quality and fitness for purpose. This talk explores the social and technical challenges of standardizing citizen science, shares the efforts already underway, and encourages the TDWG community to come together and contribute to a common agenda for research and capacity building.</p>","doi":"10.3897/tdwgproceedings.1.21123","imprint":{"publisher":"Pensoft Publishers"},"journal":{"issue":"","pages":"e21123","title":"Biodiversity Information Science and Standards","volume":"1"},"keywords":["Citizen science","data standards","interoperability"],"license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"publication_date":"2017-09-25","relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1140663"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1140662"}}]},"resource_type":{"subtype":"article","title":"Journal article","type":"publication"},"title":"Standardizing Citizen Science?"},"owners":[1161],"revision":4,"stats":{"downloads":13.0,"unique_downloads":13.0,"unique_views":4.0,"version_downloads":13.0,"version_unique_downloads":13.0,"version_unique_views":4.0,"version_views":4.0,"version_volume":628459.0,"views":4.0,"volume":628459.0},"updated":"2019-04-09T13:26:56.158799+00:00"},{"conceptdoi":"10.5281/zenodo.3346069","conceptrecid":"3346069","created":"2019-07-23T01:00:25.532266+00:00","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.3346070","files":[{"bucket":"23630e71-9c14-4198-a26a-3a6721234388","checksum":"md5:dd4ab787edbac1c3cd377ea06f41effe","key":"WS_soparc_7-15-16(1).pdf","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/23630e71-9c14-4198-a26a-3a6721234388/WS_soparc_7-15-16%281%29.pdf"},"size":160078,"type":"pdf"}],"id":3346070,"links":{"badge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.3346070.svg","bucket":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/23630e71-9c14-4198-a26a-3a6721234388","conceptbadge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.3346069.svg","conceptdoi":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3346069","doi":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3346070","html":"https://zenodo.org/record/3346070","latest":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/3346070","latest_html":"https://zenodo.org/record/3346070","self":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/3346070"},"metadata":{"access_right":"open","access_right_category":"success","creators":[{"name":"Dilley, Joshua"}],"description":"<p>Citizen Science SOPARC sheet</p>","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.3346070","license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"publication_date":"2019-07-23","related_identifiers":[{"identifier":"10.5281/zenodo.3346069","relation":"isVersionOf","scheme":"doi"}],"relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"3346070"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"3346069"}}]},"resource_type":{"subtype":"figure","title":"Figure","type":"image"},"title":"Citizen Science SOPARC sheet"},"owners":[72907],"revision":1,"stats":{"downloads":5.0,"unique_downloads":5.0,"unique_views":5.0,"version_downloads":5.0,"version_unique_downloads":5.0,"version_unique_views":5.0,"version_views":6.0,"version_volume":800390.0,"views":6.0,"volume":800390.0},"updated":"2019-07-23T01:00:26.382215+00:00"},{"conceptdoi":"10.5281/zenodo.3243401","conceptrecid":"3243401","created":"2019-06-11T13:37:52.556252+00:00","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.3243402","files":[{"bucket":"6390ec70-820c-4c18-b4ae-5484799f2bf3","checksum":"md5:8941060e8bfcba71a65668fcdb3d3b99","key":"ECSA Empowerment WG Soleri.mp4","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/6390ec70-820c-4c18-b4ae-5484799f2bf3/ECSA%20Empowerment%20WG%20Soleri.mp4"},"size":51835453,"type":"mp4"}],"id":3243402,"links":{"badge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.3243402.svg","bucket":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/6390ec70-820c-4c18-b4ae-5484799f2bf3","conceptbadge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.3243401.svg","conceptdoi":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3243401","doi":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3243402","html":"https://zenodo.org/record/3243402","latest":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/3243402","latest_html":"https://zenodo.org/record/3243402","self":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/3243402"},"metadata":{"access_right":"open","access_right_category":"success","creators":[{"affiliation":"ECSA","name":"G\u00f6bel, Claudia"},{"affiliation":"UC Santa Barbara","name":"Soleri, Daniela"}],"description":"<p>This is a recording of the presentation &quot;Equity and Citizen Science, Experiences Building the CSA Working Group&quot; by Daniela Soleri.

Citizen Science projects produce interesting results but, more than that, they challenge the shape of current scholarly processes. The OSPP has emphatically linked libraries with Citizen Science, as being &ldquo;well placed&rdquo; for a number of activities. The role they can have has been echoed in Open Science Roadmaps from LIBER and LERU. The potential that OSPP sees in libraries is a responsibility that libraries have to respond to. In this frame, the presentation will introduce the new working group of LIBER that is expected to start working after June 2019 and will give an outline of the key areas that research libraries will need to work. These areas will help us prepare a future where sustainable new structures of knowledge will help European citizens participate in scientific processes.</p>","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.2702035","keywords":["Open science","Citizen science","Innovative scholarly communication"],"language":"eng","license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"meeting":{"dates":"9 May 2019","place":"Rome","title":"Focus on Open Science Chapter XIV: Rome","url":"https://www.focusopenscience.org/book/19rome/"},"publication_date":"2019-05-10","related_identifiers":[{"identifier":"10.5281/zenodo.2702034","relation":"isVersionOf","scheme":"doi"}],"relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"2702035"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"2702034"}}]},"resource_type":{"title":"Presentation","type":"presentation"},"title":"Citizen Science as an act of innovation: librarians, scientists and citizens claiming new knowledge structures"},"owners":[45425],"revision":3,"stats":{"downloads":27.0,"unique_downloads":27.0,"unique_views":117.0,"version_downloads":27.0,"version_unique_downloads":27.0,"version_unique_views":117.0,"version_views":144.0,"version_volume":103912929.0,"views":144.0,"volume":103912929.0},"updated":"2019-05-10T13:33:17.631795+00:00"},{"conceptdoi":"10.5281/zenodo.1161921","conceptrecid":"1161921","created":"2018-01-29T08:33:45.255968+00:00","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.1161922","files":[{"bucket":"52a4e8e6-9f29-4a53-8600-f150ff703baa","checksum":"md5:99f2abb4089633954e8beffa485a6323","key":"II=Qualitaetskriterien_de_v1.0.pdf","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/52a4e8e6-9f29-4a53-8600-f150ff703baa/II%3DQualitaetskriterien_de_v1.0.pdf"},"size":162433,"type":"pdf"}],"id":1161922,"links":{"badge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.1161922.svg","bucket":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/52a4e8e6-9f29-4a53-8600-f150ff703baa","conceptbadge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.1161921.svg","conceptdoi":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1161921","doi":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1161922","html":"https://zenodo.org/record/1161922","latest":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/1161922","latest_html":"https://zenodo.org/record/1161922","self":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/1161922"},"metadata":{"access_right":"open","access_right_category":"success","creators":[{"affiliation":"Universit\u00e4t f\u00fcr Bodenkultur Wien","name":"Heigl, Florian","orcid":"0000-0002-0083-4908"},{"affiliation":"Universit\u00e4t f\u00fcr Bodenkultur Wien","name":"D\u00f6rler, Daniel","orcid":"0000-0003-2056-4084"},{"affiliation":"Zentrum f\u00fcr Soziale Innovation","name":"Bartar, Pamela"},{"affiliation":"Universit\u00e4t Graz","name":"Brodschneider, Robert"},{"affiliation":"Zentrum f\u00fcr Citizen Science bei der OeAD-GmbH","name":"Cieslinski, Marika"},{"affiliation":"Universit\u00e4t Salzburg","name":"Ernst, Marlene"},{"affiliation":"Internationales Institut f\u00fcr Angewandte Systemanalyse (IIASA)","name":"Fritz, Steffen"},{"affiliation":"Universit\u00e4t Wien","name":"Krisai-Greilhuber, Irmgard"},{"affiliation":"Internationales Institut f\u00fcr Angewandte Systemanalyse (IIASA)","name":"Hager, Gerid"},{"affiliation":"Universit\u00e4t f\u00fcr Bodenkultur Wien","name":"Hatlauf, Jennifer"},{"affiliation":"Helmholtz-Zentrum f\u00fcr Umweltforschung GmbH -

The objective of these criteria is to maintain and further improve the quality of the projects presented on the platform.</p>\n\n<p>Between March 2017 and February 2018, a working group of the platform <em>&Ouml;sterreich forscht</em> consisting of representatives from 17 institutions developed criteria that allow for the transparent evaluation of projects applying to be listed on <em>&Ouml;sterreich forscht</em>. This was a multi-stage process, building both on the knowledge of the working group members as well as on feedback repeatedly provided by external experts from the respective research fields. Throughout October 2017, a version of the quality criteria was available for public online consultation on the platform <em>&Ouml;sterreich forscht</em>, so as to incorporate the knowledge of the general public into the criteria as well.</p>\n\n<p>The final version of the quality criteria was presented at the 4th Austrian Citizen Science Conference, 1-3 February 2018, at which point the criteria also came into effect. Projects already listed on <em>&Ouml;sterreich forscht</em> can adapt to meet the criteria over the next year. Projects wishing to be newly listed on <em>&Ouml;sterreich forscht</em> must meet these criteria at the point of listing.</p>\n\n<p>Where necessary, the quality criteria will be adapted in the future, in order to respond to new challenges and developments.

In this study, we assess the effectiveness of engagement and meaningful experience of participants in citizen science projects. We use motivational measures calculated from a web survey where respondents answered questions regarding to their motivation to participate in BioDiversity4All, a Portuguese citizen science project. We adapted the intrinsic motivation inventory (IMI) and considered seven categories of measurement: Interest/Enjoyment, Perceived Competence, Effort/Importance, Perceived Choice, Value/Usefulness, Project Relatedness, and Group Relatedness each of them with statements rated on a seven-point Likert scale. We received 149 survey responses, corresponding to 10.3 % of BioDiversity4All Newsletter's receivers. We analyzed for possible differences among the categories pertaining to gender, age, level of education and level of participation in the project. Finally, we assessed the different patterns of motivation existing among the users. No statistical differences were found between genders, age classes and levels of education for the averages in any category of analysis. However, IMI categories presented different results for respondents with different levels of participation. The highest value of Interest/Enjoyment and Perceived Competence was obtained by the group of respondents that participate a lot and the lowest by the ones that never participated. Project Relatedness had the highest value for all groups except for the group that never participated. This group had completely different motivations from the other groups, showing the lowest levels in categories such as Perceived Competence, Value/Usefulness, Project Relatedness and Group Relatedness. In conclusion, the results from our work show that working deeply on people's involvement is fundamental to increase and maintain their participation on citizen science projects. If, for initial recruitment and in countries with low participation culture, mechanisms of external motivation may be necessary, to guarantee higher levels of long term participation, citizen science projects should foster intrinsic motivations which can be done by incorporating in project design experiences of relatedness, capacity building, positive feedback and adapted participation modes.</p>","doi":"10.3897/natureconservation.18.13429","imprint":{"publisher":"Pensoft Publishers"},"journal":{"issue":"","pages":"61-78","title":"Nature Conservation","volume":"18"},"keywords":["Citizen Science","Self Determination Theory","Intrinsic Motivation"],"license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"publication_date":"2017-07-21","relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1139314"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1139313"}}]},"resource_type":{"subtype":"article","title":"Journal article","type":"publication"},"title":"The influence of motivational factors on the frequency of participation in citizen science activities"},"owners":[1161],"revision":4,"stats":{"downloads":20.0,"unique_downloads":17.0,"unique_views":6.0,"version_downloads":20.0,"version_unique_downloads":17.0,"version_unique_views":6.0,"version_views":6.0,"version_volume":26582576.0,"views":6.0,"volume":26582576.0},"updated":"2019-04-09T13:26:27.477525+00:00"},{"conceptrecid":"904305","created":"2017-09-21T09:55:30.828828+00:00","doi":"10.3897/rio.2.e11563.suppl3","files":[{"bucket":"c3675ef8-b14a-4ae9-b4ae-8d3dcb5b1492","checksum":"md5:524e74d65afa21bcf697326d161e6c60","key":"oo_113205.pdf","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/c3675ef8-b14a-4ae9-b4ae-8d3dcb5b1492/oo_113205.pdf"},"size":313735,"type":"pdf"}],"id":904306,"links":{"badge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.3897/rio.2.e11563.suppl3.svg","bucket":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/c3675ef8-b14a-4ae9-b4ae-8d3dcb5b1492","doi":"https://doi.org/10.3897/rio.2.e11563.suppl3","html":"https://zenodo.org/record/904306","latest":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/904306","latest_html":"https://zenodo.org/record/904306","self":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/904306"},"metadata":{"access_right":"open","access_right_category":"success","creators":[{"affiliation":"University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia","name":"Runnel, Veljo"},{"affiliation":"Museum f\u00fcr Naturkunde Berlin, Leibniz Institute for Evolution and Biodiversity Science, Berlin, Germany","name":"Wetzel, Florian"},{"affiliation":"Agentschap Plantentuin Meise, Meise, Belgium","name":"Groom, Quentin"},{"affiliation":"Norwegian Biodiversity Information Centre, Trondheim, Norway","name":"Koch, Wouter"},{"affiliation":"GlueCAD, Haifa, Israel","name":"Pe'er, Israel"},{"affiliation":"Norwegian Biodiversity Information Centre, Trondheim, Norway","name":"Valland, Nils"},{"affiliation":"Hellenic Centre for Marine Research (HCMR), Heraklion, Greece","name":"Panteri, Emmanouela"},{"affiliation":"University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia","name":"K\u00f5ljalg, Urmas"}],"description":"Citizen science and biodiversity observations \u2013 EU BON best practice cases of initiatives, systems and tools.","doi":"10.3897/rio.2.e11563.suppl3","keywords":["citizen science","biodiversity observations","volunteering","motivation","data","data sharing","policy"],"license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"publication_date":"2016-12-22","related_identifiers":[{"identifier":"10.3897/rio.2.e11563","relation":"isSupplementTo","scheme":"doi"}],"relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"904306"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"904305"}}]},"resource_type":{"title":"Dataset","type":"dataset"},"title":"Supplementary material 3 from: Runnel V, Wetzel F, Groom Q, Koch W, Pe'er I, Valland N, Panteri E, K\u00f5ljalg U (2016) Summary report and strategy recommendations for EU citizen science gateway for biodiversity data.

Results support the idea that citizen science projects allow for a context-based learning and enable students to handle shared concerns related to their own neighborhood through a hands-on approach.</p>","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.1156535","grants":[{"acronym":"STEM4youth","code":"710577","funder":{"acronyms":["EC"],"doi":"10.13039/501100000780","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/funders/10.13039/501100000780"},"name":"European Commission"},"links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/grants/10.13039/501100000780::710577"},"program":"H2020","title":"Promotion of STEM education by key scientific challenges and their impact on our life and career perspectives"}],"imprint":{"isbn":"9781138208698","place":"Oxon, United Kingdom","publisher":"Routledge"},"keywords":["citizen science","education","rubrics","school","sea plastics","mosquito","mobility","allergies","rivers"],"language":"eng","license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"notes":"This is an Accepted Manuscript of a book chapter published by Routledge in Citizen Inquiry on Sept 11 2017, available online:\nhttp://www.routledge.com/9781315458618","part_of":{"pages":"150-175","title":"Citizen Inquiry Synthesising Science and Inquiry Learning Edited by Christothea Herodotou, Mike Sharples, Eileen Scanlon"},"publication_date":"2018-01-22","related_identifiers":[{"identifier":"10.5281/zenodo.1156534","relation":"isVersionOf","scheme":"doi"}],"relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1156535"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1156534"}}]},"resource_type":{"subtype":"section","title":"Book section","type":"publication"},"title":"High motivation and relevant scientific competencies through the introduction of citizen science at Secondary schools:: An assessment using a rubric model"},"owners":[40107],"revision":4,"stats":{"downloads":53.0,"unique_downloads":49.0,"unique_views":89.0,"version_downloads":53.0,"version_unique_downloads":49.0,"version_unique_views":89.0,"version_views":94.0,"version_volume":62274523.0,"views":94.0,"volume":62274523.0},"updated":"2019-04-09T13:31:00.536530+00:00"},{"conceptrecid":"3251270","created":"2019-06-21T04:33:29.967341+00:00","doi":"10.3897/biss.3.37002","files":[{"bucket":"6f606257-3305-4fe9-bfc2-210d4e9f75a3","checksum":"md5:a7886a2d2d39b11db00a62cbe9d8cb2d","key":"BISS_article_37002.pdf","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/6f606257-3305-4fe9-bfc2-210d4e9f75a3/BISS_article_37002.pdf"},"size":56155,"type":"pdf"},{"bucket":"6f606257-3305-4fe9-bfc2-210d4e9f75a3","checksum":"md5:ec055728d2d4f01bd33d3197687b06c4","key":"BISS_article_37002.xml","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/6f606257-3305-4fe9-bfc2-210d4e9f75a3/BISS_article_37002.xml"},"size":6491,"type":"xml"}],"id":3251271,"links":{"badge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.3897/biss.3.37002.svg","bucket":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/6f606257-3305-4fe9-bfc2-210d4e9f75a3","doi":"https://doi.org/10.3897/biss.3.37002","html":"https://zenodo.org/record/3251271","latest":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/3251271","latest_html":"https://zenodo.org/record/3251271","self":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/3251271"},"metadata":{"access_right":"open","access_right_category":"success","communities":[{"id":"biosyslit"}],"creators":[{"affiliation":"FLORON Plant Conservation Netherlands, Nijmegen, Netherlands","name":"Sparrius, Laurens"}],"description":"<p>Species distribution data is\u00a0often collected in local and regional atlas projects, in which data is collected in grid squares to ensure optimal data coverage.

However, in the Mediterranean basin, these habitats are also traditionally used for animal, wood, and cork productions. Cerambyx cerdo feeds into the wood of trees and can be perceived by forest practitioners as an umbrella species or as a pest, depending on the context. Monitoring programmes involving forest practitioners could thus focus on assessing: 1) the conservation status of the Great Capricorn beetle and habitats (distribution and abundance of insects and reproductive sites or colonised trees), 2) pest status, and 3) management options to achieve both conservational and economic benefits. Considering that Cerambyx cerdo and Cork and Holm oak forests are not priority species or habitats under the HD, targeted funding is likely to be limited for monitoring. In this context, citizen science could gather important information on the target species useful for the monitoring programmes and management. To address management questions, the citizen science based programme for Cerambyx cerdo monitoring and habitat conservation should be seen not only as citizens collecting good data sets, but also as a deeper collaboration amongst different knowledge bodies and perspectives within a community \u2013 based environmental monitoring and learning network.</p>","doi":"10.3897/natureconservation.19.12637","imprint":{"publisher":"Pensoft Publishers"},"journal":{"issue":"","pages":"97-110","title":"Nature Conservation","volume":"19"},"keywords":["Animalia","Arthropoda","Insecta","Coleoptera","Cerambycidae","Cerambyx","Cerambyx cerdo","Citizen Science","Habitats Directive","Monitoring protocol","Saproxylic beetle"],"license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"publication_date":"2017-07-31","relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1139294"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1139293"}}]},"resource_type":{"subtype":"article","title":"Journal article","type":"publication"},"title":"Monitoring and management of Cerambyx cerdo in the Mediterranean region \u2013 a review and the potential role of citizen science"},"owners":[1161],"revision":4,"stats":{"downloads":18.0,"unique_downloads":17.0,"unique_views":8.0,"version_downloads":18.0,"version_unique_downloads":17.0,"version_unique_views":8.0,"version_views":8.0,"version_volume":13950612.0,"views":8.0,"volume":13950612.0},"updated":"2019-04-09T13:26:27.003043+00:00"},{"conceptrecid":"3333070","created":"2019-07-12T04:30:36.565350+00:00","doi":"10.3897/biss.3.37782","files":[{"bucket":"ae4ede12-3e96-4a65-af63-712695a4ee27","checksum":"md5:10c5eab6093620583f3a5b4c622cb4df","key":"BISS_article_37782.pdf","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/ae4ede12-3e96-4a65-af63-712695a4ee27/BISS_article_37782.pdf"},"size":62716,"type":"pdf"},{"bucket":"ae4ede12-3e96-4a65-af63-712695a4ee27","checksum":"md5:7f8bb7027223f8c3e9f9bf05a5e07a39","key":"BISS_article_37782.xml","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/ae4ede12-3e96-4a65-af63-712695a4ee27/BISS_article_37782.xml"},"size":7650,"type":"xml"}],"id":3333071,"links":{"badge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.3897/biss.3.37782.svg","bucket":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/ae4ede12-3e96-4a65-af63-712695a4ee27","doi":"https://doi.org/10.3897/biss.3.37782","html":"https://zenodo.org/record/3333071","latest":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/3333071","latest_html":"https://zenodo.org/record/3333071","self":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/3333071"},"metadata":{"access_right":"open","access_right_category":"success","communities":[{"id":"biosyslit"}],"creators":[{"affiliation":"The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Israel","name":"Gavish-Regev, Efrat"}],"description":"<p>Citizen science biodiversity monitoring projects are becoming very common.

We need to move from cheap data labour to truly empowered citizen scientists and realise that stakeholders may not have complex scientific questions but still have questions about their environment.

The application will be part of the IUCN congress taking part in Marseille in 2020.</p>","doi":"10.3897/biss.3.38149","imprint":{"publisher":"Pensoft Publishers"},"journal":{"issue":"","pages":"e38149","title":"Biodiversity Information Science and Standards","volume":"3"},"keywords":["citizen science","participatory science","public participation","participatory action research","cognitive science","nudges"],"license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"publication_date":"2019-07-17","relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"3350965"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"3350964"}}]},"resource_type":{"subtype":"article","title":"Journal article","type":"publication"},"title":"The Quest for New Empowered Citizen Scientists"},"owners":[1161],"revision":2,"stats":{"downloads":4.0,"unique_downloads":3.0,"unique_views":2.0,"version_downloads":4.0,"version_unique_downloads":3.0,"version_unique_views":2.0,"version_views":2.0,"version_volume":222344.0,"views":2.0,"volume":222344.0},"updated":"2019-07-25T07:05:50.696693+00:00"},{"conceptdoi":"10.5281/zenodo.1119576","conceptrecid":"1119576","created":"2017-12-20T10:08:30.502022+00:00","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.1119577","files":[{"bucket":"12608107-ce3e-4e56-b8f0-bb756d21e93f","checksum":"md5:7144e103bd6895bacb9a063f52b64cb6","key":"FoAM activity report 2016 compressed web version.pdf","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/12608107-ce3e-4e56-b8f0-bb756d21e93f/FoAM%20activity%20report%202016%20compressed%20web%20version.pdf"},"size":23024670,"type":"pdf"}],"id":1119577,"links":{"badge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.1119577.svg","bucket":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/12608107-ce3e-4e56-b8f0-bb756d21e93f","conceptbadge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.1119576.svg","conceptdoi":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1119576","doi":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1119577","html":"https://zenodo.org/record/1119577","latest":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/1119577","latest_html":"https://zenodo.org/record/1119577","self":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/1119577"},"metadata":{"access_right":"open","access_right_category":"success","creators":[{"affiliation":"FoAM Kernow","name":"Griffiths, Amber","orcid":"0000-0002-7455-6795"},{"affiliation":"FoAM Kernow","name":"Griffiths, David"}],"description":"<p>This review shows selected projects from the FoAM Kernow studio in 2016.</p>\n\n<p><br>\nFoAM is a network of transdisciplinary labs at the intersection of art, science, nature and everyday life.

By crowdsourcing the capture and/or classification of scientific data, ecologists can increase the scope and resolution of the questions they tackle. Techniques for producing high quality citizen science data have led to advances in fields from plant-pollinator interactions to phenology. Here we present the potential for citizen science to stimulate civic engagement on ecological issues. Our project &ndash; <a href=\"http://www.MammalWeb.org/\">MammalWeb</a> (www.MammalWeb.org @MammalWeb) &ndash; involves citizen scientists in monitoring local mammals of northeast England with camera traps. Since 2015, we have amassed &gt;150,000 volunteer-captured wildlife images which are collaboratively classified on our publicly accessible website. In addition to the collection and classification of data by citizen scientists, we attempted to guide them in becoming ecological &ldquo;ambassadors&rdquo;. With support from a British Ecological Society Outreach Grant, we partnered with Belmont Community School and worked with a group of mainly UK Year Nine students during 2016-2017. The students not only participated in MammalWeb for data capture and classification, but were also empowered to design outreach activities for their local community. This included a community fair and filming a short documentary to share the project with a wide audience. I will also describe how the students&rsquo; outreach and the MammalWeb citizen science project in general may stimulate civic engagement on ecological issues. Participants reported an increased awareness of their local wildlife which is unlikely to have been achieved with classroom learning. Additionally, MammalWeb citizen scientists provided data leading to the capture of a non-native species and substantially improved understanding of mammal fauna informing plans for a Local Nature Reserve (LNR). Some have initiated their own camera trap projects in County Durham, England and Galloway, Scotland. This demonstrates the potential of citizen science to engage the public on ecology-related policy-making, useful in a world of rapid ecological change.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Online photo album</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/penyuan/collections/72157688996445011/\">https://www.flickr.com/photos/penyuan/collections/72157688996445011/</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Video recordings of talk</strong></p>\n\n<p>Video recordings of this talk are deposited in the Wikimedia Commons <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=File:Science_and_citizenship_-_Capacity_building_for_civic_engagement_through_the_MammalWeb_citizen_science_project.webm&amp;oldid=297540804\">here</a> and on <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/263036971\">Vimeo</a>.</p>","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.1220377","keywords":["citizen science","wildlife monitoring","ecology","crowdsourcing","camera traps","citizenship","science outreach"],"language":"eng","license":{"id":"CC-BY-SA-4.0"},"meeting":{"acronym":"BES 2017","dates":"11-14 December 2017","place":"ICC, Ghent, Belgium","session":"S9: People & Nature (Citizen Science)","session_part":"3","title":"BES, GF\u00d6, NecoV and EEF Joint Annual Meeting: Ecology Across Borders 2017","url":"https://www.britishecologicalsociety.org/events/annual-meeting-2017/"},"notes":"This presentation is saved in the Strict Office Open XML format (.pptx) by Microsoft PowerPoint 2016.

biodiversity data. Computer vision, in particular\u00a0where computers can be trained to identify species in digital photographs, has significant potential to address a number of existing challenges in citizen science.</p>\n  <p>The Biological Records Centre (www.brc.ac.uk) has been a central focus for terrestrial and freshwater citizen science in the United\u00a0Kingdom for over 50 years. We will present our research on how computer vision can be embedded in citizen science, addressing three important questions.</p>\n  \n    <em>H</em><em>ow can contextual information, such as time of year, be included in computer vision?</em> A naturalist will use a wealth of ecological knowledge about species in combination with information about where and when the image was taken to augment their decision making; we should emulate this in our AI.\n    <em>How can citizen scientists be best supported by computer vision? </em>Our ambition is not to replace identification skills with AI but to use AI to support the learning process.\n    <em>How can computer vision support our limited resource of expert verifiers as data volumes increase? </em>We receive more and more data each year, which puts a greater demand on our expert verifiers, who review all records to ensure data quality. We have been exploring how computer vision can lighten this workload.\n  \n  <p>We will present work that addresses these questions including: developing machine learning techniques that incorporate ecological information as well as images to arrive at a species classification; co-designing an identification tool to help farmers identify flowers beneficial to wildlife; and assessing the optimal combination of computer vision and expert verification to improve our verification systems.</p>","doi":"10.3897/biss.3.37085","imprint":{"publisher":"Pensoft Publishers"},"journal":{"issue":"","pages":"e37085","title":"Biodiversity Information Science and Standards","volume":"3"},"keywords":["AI","machine learning","computer vision","citizen science","verification","invasive species"],"license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"publication_date":"2019-06-13","relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"3251323"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"3251322"}}]},"resource_type":{"subtype":"article","title":"Journal article","type":"publication"},"title":"Embedding Computer Vision\u00a0in Citizen Science"},"owners":[1161],"revision":2,"stats":{"downloads":3.0,"unique_downloads":3.0,"unique_views":3.0,"version_downloads":3.0,"version_unique_downloads":3.0,"version_unique_views":3.0,"version_views":3.0,"version_volume":206706.0,"views":3.0,"volume":206706.0},"updated":"2019-06-21T07:05:45.727798+00:00"},{"conceptrecid":"1140582","created":"2018-01-09T13:56:05.011797+00:00","doi":"10.3897/tdwgproceedings.1.20348","files":[{"bucket":"f58c3b00-c2e7-430e-8b44-318b16130ad4","checksum":"md5:f8fa33cfcf394025f6e66269b8b07f8a","key":"BISS_article_20348.pdf","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/f58c3b00-c2e7-430e-8b44-318b16130ad4/BISS_article_20348.pdf"},"size":41961,"type":"pdf"},{"bucket":"f58c3b00-c2e7-430e-8b44-318b16130ad4","checksum":"md5:333696f0823bff8aecc066a453af1056","key":"BISS_article_20348.xml","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/f58c3b00-c2e7-430e-8b44-318b16130ad4/BISS_article_20348.xml"},"size":8145,"type":"xml"}],"id":1140583,"links":{"badge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.3897/tdwgproceedings.1.20348.svg","bucket":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/f58c3b00-c2e7-430e-8b44-318b16130ad4","doi":"https://doi.org/10.3897/tdwgproceedings.1.20348","html":"https://zenodo.org/record/1140583","latest":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/1140583","latest_html":"https://zenodo.org/record/1140583","self":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/1140583"},"metadata":{"access_right":"open","access_right_category":"success","communities":[{"id":"biosyslit"}],"creators":[{"affiliation":"Australian Biodiversity Information Services, Ballan, Vic., Australia","name":"Chapman, Arthur"}],"description":"<p>Flickr is a photo and web hosting social media site created by Ludicorp in 2004 and later (in 2005) acquired by Yahoo. It is largely used by people for hosting social media type photos, but through the judicious use of Tagging (including use of machine tags), APIs, grouping, tag indexing and georeferencing it has been turned into a powerful citizen science resource.</p>\n  <p>By 2015, it was estimated that there were over 10 billion images on Flickr, and there are millions of biodiversity-related images posted. Flickr provides for the creation of 'Groups' and for example, the 'Bird Photo Group' alone has over 2.7 million photographs. Of course, not all biodiversity images are named and identified, or georeferenced (although many are), but many of the Flickr Groups have established rules that allow easy identification of images with names, through tagging and machine tagging. Flickr also includes an in-house georeferencing tool, and georeferences can also be added through machine-tagging.</p>\n  <p>Data Quality is always an issue with any Citizen Science initiative, and identification from images can often be problematic. Many Flickr Groups, however, have scientists as members and these will often interact with the photographer to help identify species. At other times, through the image comments, mis-identifications are queried and suggested corrections made. Thirdly, there are several Flickr Groups established where photographers can place images they are unsure of and ask for identification advice.</p>\n  <p>In this paper, I will give several examples of Flickr Groups that are using innovative techniques for extracting and using images \u2013 for example for loading to the Encyclopedia of Life (https://www.flickr.com/groups/encyclopedia_of_life) and the Atlas of Living Australia (https://biocache.ala.org.au/occurrences/8cb21942-0b13-493f-ae1d-ee6fd158f758), as well as by Citizen Science Groups developing comprehensive field guides such as to Insects of Australia using tags to group into orders and familes (https://www.flickr.com/groups/oz_insects), Australian Rainforest Trees using complex tagging to use for species identification (https://www.flickr.com/groups/australianrainforestplants/discuss/72157604373025570), and through developing small specialist groups such as for Australian Native Plants (https://www.flickr.com/groups/australian_native_plants) Pseudoscorpions (https://www.flickr.com/groups/719103@N20), Polypores (https://www.flickr.com/groups/390204@N21), Invasive Species (https://www.flickr.com/groups/18983462@N00), Weeds of Australia (https://www.flickr.com/groups/1553999@N21), etc.</p>\n  <p>I will also explore some options for longer-term archiving of resources such as images on Flickr and other web-hosting sites.</p>","doi":"10.3897/tdwgproceedings.1.20348","imprint":{"publisher":"Pensoft Publishers"},"journal":{"issue":"","pages":"e20348","title":"Biodiversity Information Science and Standards","volume":"1"},"keywords":["Flickr \"Citizen Science\" image quality"],"license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"publication_date":"2017-08-16","relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1140583"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1140582"}}]},"resource_type":{"subtype":"article","title":"Journal article","type":"publication"},"title":"Turning Flickr into a useful Citizen Science Resource"},"owners":[1161],"revision":4,"stats":{"downloads":16.0,"unique_downloads":16.0,"unique_views":11.0,"version_downloads":16.0,"version_unique_downloads":16.0,"version_unique_views":11.0,"version_views":11.0,"version_volume":671376.0,"views":11.0,"volume":671376.0},"updated":"2019-04-09T13:26:53.855357+00:00"},{"conceptrecid":"1252591","created":"2018-05-25T04:31:45.853688+00:00","doi":"10.3897/biss.2.25838","files":[{"bucket":"01711fd6-5165-4cdf-9c1c-7aa979de995f","checksum":"md5:9c800fd1e6639465e5f1d39ffda5a7dd","key":"BISS_article_25838.pdf","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/01711fd6-5165-4cdf-9c1c-7aa979de995f/BISS_article_25838.pdf"},"size":57201,"type":"pdf"},{"bucket":"01711fd6-5165-4cdf-9c1c-7aa979de995f","checksum":"md5:fd9dcdebff17401ade27345af3f3aba4","key":"BISS_article_25838.xml","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/01711fd6-5165-4cdf-9c1c-7aa979de995f/BISS_article_25838.xml"},"size":8113,"type":"xml"}],"id":1252592,"links":{"badge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.3897/biss.2.25838.svg","bucket":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/01711fd6-5165-4cdf-9c1c-7aa979de995f","doi":"https://doi.org/10.3897/biss.2.25838","html":"https://zenodo.org/record/1252592","latest":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/1252592","latest_html":"https://zenodo.org/record/1252592","self":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/1252592"},"metadata":{"access_right":"open","access_right_category":"success","communities":[{"id":"biosyslit"}],"creators":[{"affiliation":"University of Massachusetts, Boston, Boston, United States of America|University of Massachusetts, Boston, Boston, United States of America","name":"Stevenson, Robert"}],"description":"<p>The quality of data produced by citizen science (CS) programs has been called into question by academic scientists, governments, and corporations. Their doubts arise because they perceive CS groups as intruding on the rightful opportunities of standard science and industry organizations, because of a normal skepticism of novel approaches, and because of a lack of understanding of how CS produces data.</p>\n  <p>I propose a three-pronged strategy to overcome these objections and improve trust in CS data.</p>\n  \n    <b>Develop methods for CS programs to advertise their efforts in data quality control and quality assurance (QCQA</b>). As a first step the PPSR core could incorporate a field that would allow programs to point to webpages that document the QAQC practices of each program. It is my experience that many programs think carefully about data quality, but the CS community currently lacks an established protocol to share this information.\n    <b>Define and implement best practices for generating biodiversity data using different methods</b>. Wiggins et al. 2011 published a list of approaches that can be used for QCQA in CS projects but how these approaches should be implemented has not been systematically investigated.\n    <b>Measure and report data quality</b>. If one takes the point of view that citizen science is akin to a new category of scientific instruments, then the ideas of instrument measurement and calibration can be applied CS. Scientists are well aware that any instrument needs to be calibrated before its efficacy can be established. However, because CS is new approach, the specific procedures needed for different kinds of programs are just now being worked out for the first time.\n  \n  <p>The strategy outlined above faces some specific challenges. Citizen science biodiversity programs must address two important problems that standard scientific entities encounter when sampling and monitoring biodiversity. The first is correctly identifying species. For citizens this can be a problem because they often do not have the training and background of scientist teams. Likewise, it may be difficult for CS projects to manage updating and maintaining the taxonomies of the species being investigated. A second set of challenges is the diverse kinds of biodiversity data collected by CS programs. For instances, Notes from Nature decodes that labels of museum specimens, Snapshot Serengeti identifies species of large mammals from camera trap photographs, iNaturalist collections images of species and then has a crowdsource identification processs, while eBird collects observations of birds that are immediately filtered with computer algorithms for review by the observer and if, subsequently flagged, reviewed by a local expert. Each of these programs likely requires a different set of best practices and methods to measure data quality.</p>","doi":"10.3897/biss.2.25838","imprint":{"publisher":"Pensoft Publishers"},"journal":{"issue":"","pages":"e25838","title":"Biodiversity Information Science and Standards","volume":"2"},"keywords":["citizen science","biodiversity","data quality","eBird","iNaturalist","Notes from Nature","Snapshot Serengeti","PPSR core"],"license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"publication_date":"2018-05-17","relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1252592"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1252591"}}]},"resource_type":{"subtype":"article","title":"Journal article","type":"publication"},"title":"A three-pronged strategy to improve trust in biodiversity data produced by citizen science programs"},"owners":[1161],"revision":3,"stats":{"downloads":18.0,"unique_downloads":18.0,"unique_views":6.0,"version_downloads":18.0,"version_unique_downloads":18.0,"version_unique_views":6.0,"version_views":6.0,"version_volume":1029618.0,"views":6.0,"volume":1029618.0},"updated":"2019-04-09T13:46:48.439703+00:00"},{"conceptrecid":"3251328","created":"2019-06-21T04:35:34.258765+00:00","doi":"10.3897/biss.3.37093","files":[{"bucket":"2c3793b1-9a69-4b4c-9f22-666825a238a6","checksum":"md5:8d100d43912e69206a46925bc7763d18","key":"BISS_article_37093.pdf","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/2c3793b1-9a69-4b4c-9f22-666825a238a6/BISS_article_37093.pdf"},"size":62121,"type":"pdf"},{"bucket":"2c3793b1-9a69-4b4c-9f22-666825a238a6","checksum":"md5:7e377d67206d2958c1af62b67b769750","key":"BISS_article_37093.xml","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/2c3793b1-9a69-4b4c-9f22-666825a238a6/BISS_article_37093.xml"},"size":8551,"type":"xml"}],"id":3251329,"links":{"badge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.3897/biss.3.37093.svg","bucket":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/2c3793b1-9a69-4b4c-9f22-666825a238a6","doi":"https://doi.org/10.3897/biss.3.37093","html":"https://zenodo.org/record/3251329","latest":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/3251329","latest_html":"https://zenodo.org/record/3251329","self":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/3251329"},"metadata":{"access_right":"open","access_right_category":"success","communities":[{"id":"biosyslit"}],"creators":[{"affiliation":"Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom","name":"King, Sally"},{"affiliation":"Mus\u00e9um national d'Histoire naturelle, Paris, France","name":"Pinon, Juliette"},{"affiliation":"Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom","name":"Drinkwater, Robyn"}],"description":"<p>Digitisation of specimens at the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh (RBGE) has created nearly half a million imaged specimens. With data entry from the specimen labels on herbarium sheets identified as the rate-limiting step in the digitisation workflow, the majority of specimens are databased with minimal data (filing name and geographical region), leaving a need to add further label data (collector, collecting locality, collection date etc.) to make the specimens research ready. We are exploring a number of different ways to complete data entry for specimens that have been imaged. These have included Optical Character Recognition (OCR), to identify meaningful specimen groupings to increase the speed of data entry and more recently citizen science platforms to provide accurate crowd-sourced transcriptions of specimen label data. We sent specimen images of the Australian flowering plants held at RBGE herbarium to DigiVol (https://volunteer.ala.org.au/institution/index/21309224), the citizen science platform developed alongside The Atlas of Living Australia. In 29 expeditions, 156 citizen scientists completed collection label data entry for RBGE's 41,000 specimens of Australian flowering plants.</p>\n  <p>We found that 95% of the transcriptions were completed by less than a third (27%) of the volunteers.

We found that by removing the filing name from the information provided with the expedition the number of errors in the Museum Details section of the transcription decreased, as the filing name was often added as the label name, regardless of whether this is the case. The feedback we provided for each expedition was used to highlight common errors to try and reduce their occurrence as well as to inform the volunteers of what their transcriptions had revealed about this part of the collection.

Careful application of these steps can yield valuable insights into ecological parameters. There have been highly successful citizen science projects which crowdsourced at least one of the first two steps, saving substantial time and resources for researchers. However, we believe there is potential to take citizen science camera trapping from &ldquo;citizens as sensors&rdquo; to having active participants in all phases of research, which could benefit both researchers and citizen scientists. To that end, we implemented our pilot project &ndash; MammalWeb &ndash; to integrate all three phases of camera trapping into a complete citizen science web platform. Through a partnership between Durham University and the Durham Wildlife Trust, we recruited citizen scientists from the public to deploy and monitor camera traps across the north east of England. They were trained in camera trapping methodology and asked to employ the same sampling protocol. To integrate camera trap ecology into education, computer science students at Durham University help develop the backend technology for MammalWeb, and secondary school students are leading multidisciplinary projects with teachers to create outreach material for ecological curricula and the public.<br>\nAs of February 2016, over 50 citizen scientists are monitoring camera traps at more than 130 sites across northeast England. They have uploaded over 43,000 images to MammalWeb, of which more than 28,000 have been classified by more than 100 registered users. An algorithm adapted from past work was developed by computer science students at Durham University to calculate consensus identifications of animals from the crowdsourced data, on which a user-facing dashboard is being created for participants to explore and interrogate the database. Our collaboration with secondary schools has engaged students in becoming seed ecological ambassadors, and created multimedia projects to share ecological knowledge with their communities.<br>\nIn this talk, I will describe:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>The MammalWeb user experience&nbsp;<br>\n\t&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>How our collaboration with educational institutions has produced actively involved citizen scientists in camera trap monitoring, and<br>\n\t&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>How participants help develop MammalWeb into a modular and generalisable citizen science web platform for big data ecology. This platform can then be deployed by other organisations to crowdsource their research. Lastly, I will report key challenges faced by this approach, plus the potential for future work on integrating state of the art technology into citizen science ecology.</li>\n</ol>","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.321344","keywords":["citizen science","ecology","wildlife monitoring","crowdsourcing","camera traps","science outreach"],"license":{"id":"CC-BY-SA-4.0"},"meeting":{"dates":"08 August 2016","place":"Fort Lauderdale, Florida, United States","title":"101st Ecological Society of America (ESA) Annual Conference 2016"},"publication_date":"2016-08-08","relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"321344"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"776369"}}]},"resource_type":{"title":"Presentation","type":"presentation"},"title":"MammalWeb \u2013 Participant guided development of a generalised citizen science web platform"},"owners":[19812],"revision":4,"stats":{"downloads":4.0,"unique_downloads":4.0,"unique_views":9.0,"version_downloads":4.0,"version_unique_downloads":4.0,"version_unique_views":9.0,"version_views":10.0,"version_volume":47383120.0,"views":10.0,"volume":47383120.0},"updated":"2019-03-07T16:09:47.780597+00:00"},{"conceptrecid":"3257825","created":"2019-06-27T04:31:31.345427+00:00","doi":"10.3897/biss.3.37202","files":[{"bucket":"0403e067-9321-4bd0-bba1-37b68a215b65","checksum":"md5:06a5e15e341729ca96d8770baa0a7fec","key":"BISS_article_37202.pdf","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/0403e067-9321-4bd0-bba1-37b68a215b65/BISS_article_37202.pdf"},"size":65981,"type":"pdf"},{"bucket":"0403e067-9321-4bd0-bba1-37b68a215b65","checksum":"md5:069a3036ca9e156e6ffd0c5a45442cab","key":"BISS_article_37202.xml","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/0403e067-9321-4bd0-bba1-37b68a215b65/BISS_article_37202.xml"},"size":11927,"type":"xml"}],"id":3257826,"links":{"badge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.3897/biss.3.37202.svg","bucket":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/0403e067-9321-4bd0-bba1-37b68a215b65","doi":"https://doi.org/10.3897/biss.3.37202","html":"https://zenodo.org/record/3257826","latest":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/3257826","latest_html":"https://zenodo.org/record/3257826","self":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/3257826"},"metadata":{"access_right":"open","access_right_category":"success","communities":[{"id":"biosyslit"}],"creators":[{"affiliation":"Strand Life Sciences, Bangalore, India","name":"Vattakaven, Thomas"},{"affiliation":"Metastring Foundation, Bangalore, India","name":"Surendran, Harikrishnan"},{"affiliation":"Strand Life Sciences, Bangalore, India","name":"Rajagopal, Prabhakar"}],"description":"<p>The India Biodiversity Portal\u00a0(IBP)\u00a0was initiated a decade ago, aiming to aggregate data on all species within India. The portal has been running a citizen science module for the past 8 years, aggregating observation data from the general public. The portal runs many flagship citizen science campaigns,\u00a0such as the Neighborhood Trees Campaign, National Moth Week, Spotting Alien Invasive species, Mapping Indian Snails and Slugs and\u00a0Frogwatch. We have learnt valuable lessons in harnessing participation in citizen science, implementing functionality and in integrating technological advancements into the platform codebase. Following up on these, we are implementing new features that will streamline development, entice users and further spur participation. We discuss some of the proposed changes and our justification, including the impacts we expect\u00a0in generating better citizen science data.</p>\n  <p>A key lesson arising out of our campaigns in remote regions of India, where internet penetration is relatively new, is that most users are connected to the web exclusively through a mobile device. Most do not have access to a personal computer or an email account. Yet they are internet savvy and use mobile applications to accomplish complex tasks such as banking\u00a0activities, often logging in and being authenticated exclusively through a mobile number. We are implementing short-messaging-service\u00a0(SMS)\u00a0or one-time password-based login mechanisms, for login even without an email account for authentication. Although many initiatives have been investing in platform-specific mobile apps to cater to a growing mobile user community, maintaining and updating multiple mobile apps alongside enhancements to the web version is a resource-intensive task that most platforms cannot afford. Inconsistency in functions and usability across different versions of the same platform may lead to gaps in data collection. To address this challenge and streamline development, we have begun updating the portal codebase to enable Progressive Web Apps, which will replace conventional mobile applications while also serving as Single Page Applications that provide a unified experience across device platforms and alleviating the need for updating mobile apps separately.</p>\n  <p>For existing contributors on the portal, comparisons of their contributions against other users are a motivating factor to contribute further. Leaderboards and reputation systems are proven\u00a0methods\u00a0to promote activity and provide recognition to participants. Such leaderboards also incentivise newer participants to emulate leaders and climb the boards. We are building a reputation system that not only recognizes quantity but also the quality of the user's contribution. In addition, we are working on integrating intelligent push notification technology that will constantly engage users by keeping them abreast of activity related to content reflecting\u00a0their interest on the portal. These features are expected to engage contributors and keep them motivated towards further data contributions.</p>\n  <p>Finally, the most rewarding outcome from contributing citizen science data is in visualizing its impact. The most obvious are improvements in species distribution maps that are generated for each species page on the portal. Users are greatly motivated by contributing data that may enhance known distributions and may constitute range extensions for a species. Distribution maps on the portal are being revamped so that information is presented to the user in real-time through visualisations that are are both attractive and easy to interpret. These will provide users with gratification and help spur participation further.</p>\n  <p>IBP is also instituting the ability to automate the classification of its data to identify publication-grade data. Through a combination of user's reputation and other data quality criteria, the data on IBP will be automatically graded, allowing such data to be pushed to Global Biodiversity Information Facility on a periodic basis as a Darwin Core Archive, contributing\u00a0to global biodiversity data.</p>","doi":"10.3897/biss.3.37202","imprint":{"publisher":"Pensoft Publishers"},"journal":{"issue":"","pages":"e37202","title":"Biodiversity Information Science and Standards","volume":"3"},"keywords":["citizen science","technology","participation","biodiversity","biodiversity data","progressive web app","reputation system","leaderboards","mobile application","India","India Biodiversity Portal"],"license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"publication_date":"2019-06-19","relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"3257826"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"3257825"}}]},"resource_type":{"subtype":"article","title":"Journal article","type":"publication"},"title":"A decade of the India Biodiversity Portal:\u00a0Planning ahead with technology to enhance citizen science participation in India"},"owners":[1161],"revision":2,"stats":{"downloads":4.0,"unique_downloads":4.0,"unique_views":3.0,"version_downloads":4.0,"version_unique_downloads":4.0,"version_unique_views":3.0,"version_views":3.0,"version_volume":263924.0,"views":3.0,"volume":263924.0},"updated":"2019-06-27T07:05:44.718453+00:00"},{"conceptdoi":"10.5281/zenodo.1454510","conceptrecid":"1454510","created":"2018-10-10T13:02:18.544837+00:00","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.1454511","files":[{"bucket":"39b4361e-801d-4962-b400-53371b64b132","checksum":"md5:728453478734fe919e6acb6f2cb12514","key":"Citizenscience_Article.docx","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/39b4361e-801d-4962-b400-53371b64b132/Citizenscience_Article.docx"},"size":52147,"type":"docx"}],"id":1454511,"links":{"badge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.1454511.svg","bucket":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/39b4361e-801d-4962-b400-53371b64b132","conceptbadge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.1454510.svg","conceptdoi":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1454510","doi":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1454511","html":"https://zenodo.org/record/1454511","latest":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/1454511","latest_html":"https://zenodo.org/record/1454511","self":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/1454511"},"metadata":{"access_right":"open","access_right_category":"success","creators":[{"name":"Frane Adam"},{"name":"Barbara Tom\u0161i\u010d"}],"description":"<p><em>In the text, high school students involvement in research activities is explored.

The economic value of sharks has traditionally been measured as the total value of sharks caught for liver oil, fins, or meat for consumption. Sharks have also been killed to near extinction in cases where they were seen as a threat to fisheries on other species. This is illustrated by the mass extermination of Basking Sharks (<em>Cetorhinus maximus</em>) in British Columbia. They were seen as a nuisance to fishermen as they got entangled in gill nets during the salmon fishing season. However with the development of the SCUBA diving industry, and ecotourism in general, increased awareness of the role sharks play in marine ecosystems has resulted in changes in how they are perceived and utilized. Despite an ongoing harvest of sharks such as the North Pacific Spiny Dogfish (<em>Squalus suckleyi</em>), sharks now generate economic value through SCUBA diving enthusiasts who travel the globe to see, swim with, and photograph them. The use of digital cameras and other digital media has brought sharks into households around the world and increased awareness of the conservation issues facing many species. This renewed appreciation has led to a better understanding of sharks by the public, resulting in advocates calling for better protections and conservation. In particular, a growing part of the SCUBA diving community wants to contribute to conservation and research projects, which has led to participation in citizen science projects. These projects provide scientific data but also gain ground as ecotourism activities, thus adding to both economic value of tourism and conservation efforts.</p>","doi":"10.1016/bs.amb.2017.08.003","imprint":{"isbn":"9780128123942","publisher":"Academic Press"},"keywords":["Shark conservation; Economic value; Shark tourism; Citizen science; Marine ecotourism"],"part_of":{"pages":"318","title":"NORTHEAST PACIFIC SHARK BIOLOGY, RESEARCH AND CONSERVATION"},"publication_date":"2017-09-25","relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"995981"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"995980"}}]},"resource_type":{"subtype":"section","title":"Book section","type":"publication"},"title":"The economy of shark conservation: the role of eco-tourism and citizen science"},"owners":[25347],"revision":3,"stats":{"downloads":0.0,"unique_downloads":0.0,"unique_views":3.0,"version_downloads":0.0,"version_unique_downloads":0.0,"version_unique_views":3.0,"version_views":3.0,"version_volume":0.0,"views":3.0,"volume":0.0},"updated":"2017-09-25T08:23:31.251871+00:00"},{"conceptrecid":"1150271","created":"2018-01-17T07:05:24.019137+00:00","doi":"10.3897/rio.4.e23394.figure1","files":[{"bucket":"5aeb76df-215a-4085-b764-d1649afdf4e1","checksum":"md5:9ab17e65d156e616f3cfda92f1d50cb8","key":"oo_173530.png","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/5aeb76df-215a-4085-b764-d1649afdf4e1/oo_173530.png"},"size":158242,"type":"png"}],"id":1150272,"links":{"badge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.3897/rio.4.e23394.figure1.svg","bucket":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/5aeb76df-215a-4085-b764-d1649afdf4e1","doi":"https://doi.org/10.3897/rio.4.e23394.figure1","html":"https://zenodo.org/record/1150272","latest":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/1150272","latest_html":"https://zenodo.org/record/1150272","self":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/1150272","thumb250":"https://zenodo.org/api/iiif/v2/5aeb76df-215a-4085-b764-d1649afdf4e1:4d1e7281-2d4b-457b-806f-b41ba439dbff:oo_173530.png/full/250,/0/default.png"},"metadata":{"access_right":"open","access_right_category":"success","creators":[{"affiliation":"Museum fuer Naturkunde, Leibniz Institute for Research on Evolution and Biodiversity, Berlin, Germany","name":"Sturm, Ulrike"},{"affiliation":"European Commission, Ispra, Italy","name":"Schade, Sven"},{"affiliation":"1000001 Labs, Barcelona, Spain","name":"Ceccaroni, Luigi"},{"affiliation":"Natural History Museum London, London, United Kingdom","name":"Gold, Margaret"},{"affiliation":"GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences, Potsdam, Germany","name":"Kyba, Christopher"},{"affiliation":"Centre for Research on Ecology and Forestry Applications (CREAF), Barcelona, Spain","name":"Claramunt, Bernat"},{"affiliation":"University College London, London, United Kingdom","name":"Haklay, Muki"},{"affiliation":"University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden","name":"Kasperowski, Dick"},{"affiliation":"University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom","name":"Albert, Alexandra"},{"affiliation":"Institute of Marine Sciences (ICM-CSIC), Barcelona, Spain","name":"Piera, Jaume"},{"affiliation":"University of Maryland, College Park, United States of America","name":"Brier, Jonathan"},{"affiliation":"University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden","name":"Kullenberg, Christopher"},{"affiliation":"European Citizen Science Association (ECSA), Berlin, Germany","name":"Luna, Soledad"}],"description":"Figure 1 Definitions in order to establish a common understanding for app, webpage, platform and portal and considering that the boundaries are not always clear and in some cases tools might act as a portal and a platform at the same time.","doi":"10.3897/rio.4.e23394.figure1","keywords":["Citizen science","digital technologies","design","reuse","interoperability","sustainability"],"license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"publication_date":"2018-01-17","related_identifiers":[{"identifier":"10.3897/rio.4.e23394","relation":"isPartOf","scheme":"doi"}],"relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1150272"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1150271"}}]},"resource_type":{"subtype":"figure","title":"Figure","type":"image"},"title":"Figure 1 from: Sturm U, Schade S, Ceccaroni L, Gold M, Kyba C, Claramunt B, Haklay M, Kasperowski D, Albert A, Piera J, Brier J, Kullenberg C, Luna S (2018) Defining principles for mobile apps and platforms development in citizen science.

The new citizen science program eOceans helps to fill this gap by gathering observations of various marine animals from worldwide ocean explorers. In 2012, a dedicated Thailand-wide census of sharks, and other animals, began as collaboration between eOceans scientists and the dive tourism industry. Using the observations from 9,524 dives (9,357 hours underwater) logged by &gt;169 divers on 153 sites, we describe the spatial and temporal patterns of sharks in coastal Thailand. A total of 12 shark species were encountered, most commonly (67%) as individuals, and were observed on 11% of all dives, on 59% of sites, in all months and years. The two most frequently encountered species were blacktip reef (<em>Carcharhinus melanopterus</em>) and leopard sharks (<em>Stegostoma fasciatum</em>). Many species had peak encounter rates in summer, but aggregated in various seasons in different years. Mating events and nursery sites were observed rarely, and only for blacktip reef and whitetip reef (<em>Triaenodon obesus</em>) sharks. These results could be of value to species- or region-specific biologists, ecologists and fisheries scientists, as well as to managers and policy makers that could use the findings to monitor future trends and prioritize conservation strategies. Moreover, this study highlights the value that collaborative eOceans citizen science projects could have in support of marine science, management and conservation efforts worldwide.</p>","doi":"10.1101/296160","keywords":["Citizen science","Sharks","Conservation","Spatiotemporal ecology","Visual census","Thailand","Tourism"],"license":{"id":"CC-BY-NC-ND-4.0"},"publication_date":"2018-04-06","relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1216796"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1216795"}}]},"resource_type":{"subtype":"article","title":"Journal article","type":"publication"},"title":"eOceans dive-logs for science and conservation: a case study of sharks in Thailand"},"owners":[44773],"revision":3,"stats":{"downloads":15.0,"unique_downloads":13.0,"unique_views":7.0,"version_downloads":15.0,"version_unique_downloads":13.0,"version_unique_views":7.0,"version_views":7.0,"version_volume":43050975.0,"views":7.0,"volume":43050975.0},"updated":"2018-04-16T19:04:37.361052+00:00"},{"conceptrecid":"1140010","created":"2018-01-09T12:55:53.969678+00:00","doi":"10.3897/ib.4.14916","files":[{"bucket":"3f3c7ae2-198e-4a64-b8a8-c5d28d4e3828","checksum":"md5:7e72089c0c81aa4289668a1366a6643e","key":"IB_article_14916.pdf","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/3f3c7ae2-198e-4a64-b8a8-c5d28d4e3828/IB_article_14916.pdf"},"size":3946324,"type":"pdf"},{"bucket":"3f3c7ae2-198e-4a64-b8a8-c5d28d4e3828","checksum":"md5:eb3e2ae8b22b8d30e77a9f3a6b687e54","key":"IB_article_14916.xml","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/3f3c7ae2-198e-4a64-b8a8-c5d28d4e3828/IB_article_14916.xml"},"size":76629,"type":"xml"}],"id":1140011,"links":{"badge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.3897/ib.4.14916.svg","bucket":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/3f3c7ae2-198e-4a64-b8a8-c5d28d4e3828","doi":"https://doi.org/10.3897/ib.4.14916","html":"https://zenodo.org/record/1140011","latest":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/1140011","latest_html":"https://zenodo.org/record/1140011","self":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/1140011"},"metadata":{"access_right":"open","access_right_category":"success","communities":[{"id":"biosyslit"}],"creators":[{"affiliation":"Unaffiliated, Teano, Italy","name":"Croce, Antonio"},{"affiliation":"Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Napoli Federico II, Naples, Italy","name":"Nazzaro, Roberto"}],"description":"<p>A database of the orchids of Campania has been built up since 2000 with data collected for academic purposes, research projects and, more recently, with the contributions of enthusiastic amateurs and scholars, thus becoming a real citizen science project leading to the realization of an online Atlas (http://www.floracampana.unina.it/Orchidee/index.html). In this paper, the collection and storage of the data and the synthesis of them are presented. On 31 December 2016, the database accounted for 14680 records from more than 30 contributors relating to 126 taxonomic entities (species, subspecies, hybrids and a few \"sensu lato\"). The bibliographic records number 3663 (24.9%) and cover a time range of four centuries (from 1616 to 2016). Amongst the 11017 field records (observations), more than 99% are geo-referred and are \"punctual\" type (precision less than 100 m). The spatial and temporal distribution of the data has been analysed and biases have been underlined. The observations show a clear difference in the study effort year by year but always with a significant contribution of the citizen scientists. The analysis of the spatial distribution shows that the observations are preferably collected in protected areas, around main roads and on the roadsides.

While their measurement quality does not compete with high-end instrumentation deployed in official air quality monitoring stations, they have a great potential to complement existing air quality assessments. However, we still see challenges related to data quality, data interoperability, and for collaborating on data assimilation and calibration. In order to move ahead we gathered as a group of 38 organisations from 14 different countries, including governmental authorities, network operators, citizen science initiatives, environmental Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs), and academic researchers to explore how we can collaborate and better leverage each other's work. This statement captures our joint findings and recommendations.</p>\n  <p>\n    Our key observations include:\n  </p>\n  <ul>\n    Co-operation between official monitoring networks (reference quality data) and lower-cost sensor operators is a key to make air quality data more usable.\n    To be able to combine forces and benefit from each other's expertise, the different perspectives of all stakeholders should be taken into account.\n    There is a need to ensure that all users understand the possibilities and the limitations of making sense out of observations from different sensors.\n    It is not realistic to expect that in the near future the data quality of lower-cost sensors will be as good as that of the official data. A way to make use of data that is of lower accuracy is by employing them in air quality modelling.\n    Transparency about data quality is important to build more trust in the data, and to avoid unrealistic expectations.\n    The need for interoperability should be clearly articulated and promoted by potential data users.\n    There a need (and an opportunity) to provide guidance and standard operating procedures for the deployment and calibration of lower-cost sensors in order to increase the data quality delivered by participants of citizen science projects.\n    Presently, we prefer to consider fixed-stationary sensors in a network instead of mobile sensor data. Furthermore, stationary data should not be aggregated with data from mobile sensors.\n    Publishing and sharing this statement is only small step in the right direction and further actions have to be taken, inlcuding more in-depth discussions of the recommendations in smaller groups and follow-up meetings on dedicated topics.\n  </ul>","doi":"10.3897/rio.5.e37478","imprint":{"publisher":"Pensoft Publishers"},"journal":{"issue":"","pages":"e37478","title":"Research Ideas and Outcomes","volume":"5"},"keywords":["air quality","air pollution","low-cost sensing","citizen science","expert","stakeholders","joint statement"],"license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"publication_date":"2019-06-18","relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"3256739"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"3256738"}}]},"resource_type":{"subtype":"article","title":"Journal article","type":"publication"},"title":"Joint Statement on new opportunities for air quality sensing -

However, these data are often not available in formats that facilitate use and synthesis. New approaches are needed to enhance the rates of digitization and data quality improvement. Notes from Nature provides one such novel approach by asking citizen scientists to help with transcription tasks. The initial web-based prototype of Notes from Nature is soon widely available and was developed collaboratively by biodiversity scientists, natural history collections staff, and experts in citizen science project development, programming and visualization. This project brings together digital images representing different types of biodiversity records including ledgers , herbarium sheets and pinned insects from multiple projects and natural history collections. Experts in developing web-based citizen science applications then designed and built a platform for transcribing textual data and metadata from these images. The end product is a fully open source web transcription tool built using the latest web technologies. The platform keeps volunteers engaged by initially explaining the scientific importance of the work via a short orientation, and then providing transcription \u201cmissions\u201d of well defined scope, along with dynamic feedback, interactivity and rewards. Transcribed records, along with record-level and process metadata, are provided back to the institutions. While the tool is being developed with new users in mind, it can serve a broad range of needs from novice to trained museum specialist. Notes from Nature has the potential to speed the rate of biodiversity data being made available to a broad community of users.</p>","doi":"10.3897/zookeys.209.3472","journal":{"issue":"","pages":"219-233","title":"ZooKeys","volume":"209"},"keywords":["Natural History Museums","Biodiversity","Open Source","Museum Collections","Citizen Science","Digitization","Transcription"],"license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"publication_date":"2012-07-20","relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"292413"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"774529"}}]},"resource_type":{"subtype":"article","title":"Journal article","type":"publication"},"title":"The notes from nature tool for unlocking biodiversity records from museum records through citizen science"},"owners":[1161],"revision":6,"stats":{"downloads":2.0,"unique_downloads":2.0,"unique_views":4.0,"version_downloads":2.0,"version_unique_downloads":2.0,"version_unique_views":4.0,"version_views":4.0,"version_volume":4317240.0,"views":4.0,"volume":4317240.0},"updated":"2019-02-18T21:03:48.927813+00:00"},{"conceptrecid":"1317949","created":"2018-07-20T10:28:40.079949+00:00","doi":"10.3916/C54-2018-03","files":[{"bucket":"7a00ad5c-ce84-47b4-adbc-f2254ddb74ea","checksum":"md5:bb04451b2cbc5d190f69333c75444d71","key":"10.3916_C54-2018-03-english.pdf","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/7a00ad5c-ce84-47b4-adbc-f2254ddb74ea/10.3916_C54-2018-03-english.pdf"},"size":1882992,"type":"pdf"},{"bucket":"7a00ad5c-ce84-47b4-adbc-f2254ddb74ea","checksum":"md5:e081d3666a94affb592b2be1c4e3d36f","key":"10.3916_C54-2018-03.pdf","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/7a00ad5c-ce84-47b4-adbc-f2254ddb74ea/10.3916_C54-2018-03.pdf"},"size":1863370,"type":"pdf"}],"id":1317950,"links":{"badge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.3916/C54-2018-03.svg","bucket":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/7a00ad5c-ce84-47b4-adbc-f2254ddb74ea","doi":"https://doi.org/10.3916/C54-2018-03","html":"https://zenodo.org/record/1317950","latest":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/1317950","latest_html":"https://zenodo.org/record/1317950","self":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/1317950"},"metadata":{"access_right":"open","access_right_category":"success","creators":[{"affiliation":"Universitat Oberta de Catalunya","name":"Senabre, Enric","orcid":"0000-0002-6169-6676"},{"affiliation":"Universitat Oberta de Catalunya","name":"Ferran-Ferrer, N\u00faria","orcid":"0000-0002-9037-8837"},{"affiliation":"Universitat de Barcelona","name":"Perell\u00f3, Josep","orcid":"0000-0001-8533-6539"}],"description":"<p>This article describes and analyzes the collaborative design of a citizen science research project through co-creation. Three groups of secondary school students and a team of scientists conceived three experiments on human behavior and social capital in urban and public spaces. The study goal is to address how interdisciplinary work and attention to social concerns and needs, as well as the collective construction of research questions, can be integrated into scientific research. The 95 students participating in the project answered a survey to evaluate their perception about the dynamics and tools used in the co-creation process of each experiment, and the five scientists responded to a semi-structured interview. The results from the survey and interviews demonstrate how citizen science can achieve a &ldquo;co-created&rdquo; modality beyond the usual &ldquo;contributory&rdquo; paradigm, which usually only involves the public or amateurs in data collection stages. This type of more collaborative science was made possible by the adaptation of materials and facilitation mechanisms, as well as the promotion of key aspects in research such as trust, creativity and transparency. The results also point to the possibility of adopting similar co-design strategies in other contexts of scientific collaboration and collaborative knowledge generation.</p>","doi":"10.3916/C54-2018-03","grants":[{"acronym":"STEM4youth","code":"710577","funder":{"acronyms":["EC"],"doi":"10.13039/501100000780","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/funders/10.13039/501100000780"},"name":"European Commission"},"links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/grants/10.13039/501100000780::710577"},"program":"H2020","title":"Promotion of STEM education by key scientific challenges and their impact on our life and career perspectives"}],"journal":{"pages":"29-38","title":"Comunicar","volume":"54"},"keywords":["citizen science","co-creation","co-design","knowledge","toolkit","interdisciplinarity","participation","open science"],"language":"eng","license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"publication_date":"2018-07-20","relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1317950"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1317949"}}]},"resource_type":{"subtype":"article","title":"Journal article","type":"publication"},"title":"Participatory design of citizen science experiments"},"owners":[40107],"revision":5,"stats":{"downloads":49.0,"unique_downloads":43.0,"unique_views":42.0,"version_downloads":49.0,"version_unique_downloads":43.0,"version_unique_views":42.0,"version_views":46.0,"version_volume":92188120.0,"views":46.0,"volume":92188120.0},"updated":"2019-04-09T14:05:26.990764+00:00"},{"conceptrecid":"1252595","created":"2018-05-25T04:31:54.896232+00:00","doi":"10.3897/biss.2.26665","files":[{"bucket":"3cf29b7c-c3e6-4d2d-9598-88ebca3ac3d8","checksum":"md5:20aac3419f54f186d2bc225cabfecb96","key":"BISS_article_26665.pdf","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/3cf29b7c-c3e6-4d2d-9598-88ebca3ac3d8/BISS_article_26665.pdf"},"size":43055,"type":"pdf"},{"bucket":"3cf29b7c-c3e6-4d2d-9598-88ebca3ac3d8","checksum":"md5:5e43b04fc4538a78f9e5d878d200f124","key":"BISS_article_26665.xml","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/3cf29b7c-c3e6-4d2d-9598-88ebca3ac3d8/BISS_article_26665.xml"},"size":8759,"type":"xml"}],"id":1252596,"links":{"badge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.3897/biss.2.26665.svg","bucket":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/3cf29b7c-c3e6-4d2d-9598-88ebca3ac3d8","doi":"https://doi.org/10.3897/biss.2.26665","html":"https://zenodo.org/record/1252596","latest":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/1252596","latest_html":"https://zenodo.org/record/1252596","self":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/1252596"},"metadata":{"access_right":"open","access_right_category":"success","communities":[{"id":"biosyslit"}],"creators":[{"affiliation":"Centre for Applied Conservation Science, School of Biological Sciences, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, Australia","name":"Stenhouse, Alan"},{"affiliation":"School of Natural and Built Environments, University of South Australia, Adelaide, Australia","name":"Roetman, Philip"},{"affiliation":"Department of Genetics and Evolution, School of Biological Sciences, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, Australia","name":"Gr\u00fctzner, Frank"},{"affiliation":"Department of Genetics and Evolution, School of Biological Sciences, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, Australia","name":"Perry, Tahlia"},{"affiliation":"Centre for Applied Conservation Science, School of Biological Sciences, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, Australia","name":"Koh, Lian Pin"}],"description":"<p>Field data collection by Citizen Scientists has been hugely assisted by the rapid development and spread of smart phones as well as apps that make use of the integrated technologies contained in these devices.

While their measurement quality does not compete with high-end instrumentation deployed in official air quality monitoring stations, they have a great potential to complement existing air quality assessments. However, we still see challenges related to data quality, data interoperability, and for collaborating on data assimilation and calibration. In order to move ahead we gathered as a group of 38 organisations from 14 different countries, including governmental authorities, network operators, citizen science initiatives, environmental Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs), and academic researchers to explore how we can collaborate and better leverage each other's work. This statement captures our joint findings and recommendations.</p>\n  <p>\n    Our key observations include:\n  </p>\n  <ul>\n    Co-operation between official monitoring networks (reference quality data) and lower-cost sensor operators is a key to make air quality data more usable.\n    To be able to combine forces and benefit from each other's expertise, the different perspectives of all stakeholders should be taken into account.\n    There is a need to ensure that all users understand the possibilities and the limitations of making sense out of observations from different sensors.\n    It is not realistic to expect that in the near future the data quality of lower-cost sensors will be as good as that of the official data. A way to make use of data that is of lower accuracy is by employing them in air quality modelling.\n    Transparency about data quality is important to build more trust in the data, and to avoid unrealistic expectations.\n    The need for interoperability should be clearly articulated and promoted by potential data users.\n    There a need (and an opportunity) to provide guidance and standard operating procedures for the deployment and calibration of lower-cost sensors in order to increase the data quality delivered by participants of citizen science projects.\n    Presently, we prefer to consider fixed-stationary sensors in a network instead of mobile sensor data. Furthermore, stationary data should not be aggregated with data from mobile sensors.\n    Publishing and sharing this statement is only small step in the right direction and further actions have to be taken, inlcuding more in-depth discussions of the recommendations in smaller groups and follow-up meetings on dedicated topics.\n  </ul>","doi":"10.3897/rio.5.e34059","imprint":{"publisher":"Pensoft Publishers"},"journal":{"issue":"","pages":"e34059","title":"Research Ideas and Outcomes","volume":"5"},"keywords":["air quality","air pollution","low-cost sensing","citizen science","expert","stakeholders","joint statement"],"license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"publication_date":"2019-06-05","relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"3244519"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"3244518"}}]},"resource_type":{"subtype":"article","title":"Journal article","type":"publication"},"title":"Joint Statement on new opportunities for air quality sensing - lower-cost sensors for public authorities and citizen science initiatives"},"owners":[1161],"revision":2,"stats":{"downloads":3.0,"unique_downloads":3.0,"unique_views":3.0,"version_downloads":3.0,"version_unique_downloads":3.0,"version_unique_views":3.0,"version_views":3.0,"version_volume":368136.0,"views":3.0,"volume":368136.0},"updated":"2019-06-14T07:05:45.019018+00:00"},{"conceptrecid":"3251272","created":"2019-06-21T04:33:33.867122+00:00","doi":"10.3897/biss.3.37010","files":[{"bucket":"13f505d4-d2ae-4095-9964-438cc9c28fa3","checksum":"md5:b76b40a122ea25274cba40e60f07772c","key":"BISS_article_37010.pdf","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/13f505d4-d2ae-4095-9964-438cc9c28fa3/BISS_article_37010.pdf"},"size":61761,"type":"pdf"},{"bucket":"13f505d4-d2ae-4095-9964-438cc9c28fa3","checksum":"md5:5559c9350e9bec99c550cc03cd1315fa","key":"BISS_article_37010.xml","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/13f505d4-d2ae-4095-9964-438cc9c28fa3/BISS_article_37010.xml"},"size":9609,"type":"xml"}],"id":3251273,"links":{"badge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.3897/biss.3.37010.svg","bucket":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/13f505d4-d2ae-4095-9964-438cc9c28fa3","doi":"https://doi.org/10.3897/biss.3.37010","html":"https://zenodo.org/record/3251273","latest":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/3251273","latest_html":"https://zenodo.org/record/3251273","self":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/3251273"},"metadata":{"access_right":"open","access_right_category":"success","communities":[{"id":"biosyslit"}],"creators":[{"affiliation":"Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China","name":"Lin, Congtian"},{"affiliation":"Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China","name":"Wang, Jiangning"},{"affiliation":"Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China","name":"Ji, Liqiang"}],"description":"<p>Biodiversity research is stepping into\u00a0a\u00a0big data era with the rapid increase in the abundance of biodiversity data, especially the large number of species images. It has been a new trend and hot topic on how to utilize artificial intelligence to mine big biodiversity data to support wildlife observation and recognition. In this research, we integrate large numbers of species images, including higher plants, birds and insects, and use a state-of-the-art image deep learning technique to train species auto-recognition models. Currently, we get a model that can recognize more than 900 Chinese birds with top 1 accuracy 81% and top 5 accuracy 95%\u00a0(top n accuracy means the probability that the correct answer presents in top n predicted results), and more models are coming soon. Based on these models, we developed a platform named Notes of Life (NOL,\u00a0http://nol.especies.cn), which includes a website and a mobile application (app) for assisting biological scientists and citizen scientists to recognize and record wildlife. Users can upload their observation records and images of wildlife through\u00a0our\u00a0mobile app while they are investigating in the wild. The website is\u00a0used\u00a0for bulk data uploading and management. Species images can be classified by\u00a0taxon-specific,\u00a0plug-in recognition models\u00a0that speed up the process of identification.\u00a0There is an expert module in NOL where\u00a0citizen scientists can work interactively with information provided by biological scientists, and post a species image identification request to experts when they cannot recognize the species by themselves or\u00a0from\u00a0models. The\u00a0expert module is for improving the quality of citizen science data, and it is a supplement of the disadvantage of species auto-recognition models.

Smartphones have become part of the daily lives of millions of people, allowing the general public to collect data and conduct automatic measurements at a very low cost. Indeed, a series of Citizen Science mobile applications have allowed citizens to rapidly record specimen observations and contribute for the development of large biodiversity databases around the World. Citizen Science applications have a multitude of purposes, as well as target a variety of taxa, biological questions and geographical regions.</p>\n  <p>Brazil is a megadiverse country that includes many threatened species and Biomes. Conversation efforts are urgent and the engagement of the civil society is critical. Brazilian dry and wet forests are dominated by members of the plant family <i>Bignoniaceae</i>, all of which are characterized by beautiful trumpet-shaped flowers and a big-bang flowering strategy. Species of the Neotropical <i>Bignoniaceae</i> trees are popularly known in Brazil as \"Ip\u00ea\" and are broadly cultivated throughout the country due to the showy flowers and strong wood. Different species have different flower colors, making its identification relatively easy. The showy and colorful flowers are extremely admired by the local population and the media. Flowering of \"Ip\u00eas\" is triggered by dry climate, lower temperatures and increasing day-light, making this group an excellent model for phenological and climatic studies involving Citizen Science.</p>\n  <p>Here, we developed a multi-platform mobile application focused on the plant family <i>Bignoniaceae</i> that allows users to contribute phenological data for species from this plant family. More specifically, through this application the user is able to provide data about specimen locations, phenology and date, all of which can be validated by a photograph. This platform is based on React Native, a hybrid app framework that helps the developers to reuse the code across multiple mobile platforms, a development much more efficient and with efforts focused on the user experience. This technology uses Javascript as programming language and Facebook React as a basis for development. The system is similar to other CS apps such as iNaturalist. Namely, the overall observations improve the quality of the ranking through positive feedback from the community, strengthening the network of interactions between users and encouraging active participation. On the other hand, the application allows users to access all previously stored observations, which, in turn, can suggest improvements to that particular observation. Furthermore, observations without a correct ID can be stored until others can suggest a correct identification, maximizing the value of individual observations and data gathered.</p>\n  <p>An important aspect of this mobile application is the participation of a network of experts on this plant family, allowing a rapid and accurate verification of individual observations. This team of <i>Bignoniaceae</i> experts is also able to make full use of the data gathered by correlating climate and phenological patterns. Results from these analyses are provided to the citizens gathering the data which will, in turn, stimulate the collection of new data, especially in poorly sampled locations. This is a very dynamic mobile application, that aims to engage the civil society with true scientific research, stimulating the management of natural resources and conservation efforts. Through this mobile app, we hope to engage the general public into biodiversity studies by improving their knowledge on an iconic group of Brazilian plants, while contributing data for scientific studies. The system is expected to be released in May and will be available at ipesdobrasil.org.br.</p>","doi":"10.3897/biss.2.25582","imprint":{"publisher":"Pensoft Publishers"},"journal":{"issue":"","pages":"e25582","title":"Biodiversity Information Science and Standards","volume":"2"},"keywords":["Citizen Science","Bignoniaceae","Mobile Application"],"license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"publication_date":"2018-04-06","relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1249090"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1249089"}}]},"resource_type":{"subtype":"article","title":"Journal article","type":"publication"},"title":"A Multi-platform Mobile Application to Collect Citizen Science Data for Bignoniaceae Phenological Research"},"owners":[1161],"revision":3,"stats":{"downloads":15.0,"unique_downloads":15.0,"unique_views":5.0,"version_downloads":15.0,"version_unique_downloads":15.0,"version_unique_views":5.0,"version_views":5.0,"version_volume":847170.0,"views":5.0,"volume":847170.0},"updated":"2019-04-09T13:45:59.460645+00:00"},{"conceptdoi":"10.5281/zenodo.2579767","conceptrecid":"2579767","created":"2019-02-28T10:27:56.927645+00:00","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.2579768","files":[{"bucket":"dc73f8ce-e83b-44e0-90e9-86862dc711b7","checksum":"md5:96d0e6619ddfe575891358fce977ba31","key":"exple4_P01978557_multi-determined_output_example.xlsx","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/dc73f8ce-e83b-44e0-90e9-86862dc711b7/exple4_P01978557_multi-determined_output_example.xlsx"},"size":11080,"type":"xlsx"}],"id":2579768,"links":{"badge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.2579768.svg","bucket":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/dc73f8ce-e83b-44e0-90e9-86862dc711b7","conceptbadge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.2579767.svg","conceptdoi":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2579767","doi":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2579768","html":"https://zenodo.org/record/2579768","latest":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/2579768","latest_html":"https://zenodo.org/record/2579768","self":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/2579768"},"metadata":{"access_right":"open","access_right_category":"success","creators":[{"affiliation":"Mus\u00e9um national d'Histoire naturelle, Paris","name":"Le Bras, Gwena\u00ebl"}],"description":"<p>Illustrative example of data format following Darwin Core sent back from a citizen science platform to the relevant collection management system.

Numerous studies have confirmed that autistic people experience sensory processing differences which can significantly impact their lives. One aspect which is not yet fully understood is how these differences affect the ways in which autistic people navigate different environments. At this week&#39;s SWC AlternaTea Hour, Dr Sarah Markham (KCL) and I will describe the process and values that we have defined to build a project that is participatory from the ground up. Flipping the traditional scientific study on its head, our goal is to give a voice to the autistic citizen scientists and educate neurotypical people. We seek to empower everyone in supporting autistic people and their families in living long, healthy, happy lives.</p>","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.2638051","license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"publication_date":"2019-04-12","related_identifiers":[{"identifier":"10.5281/zenodo.2638050","relation":"isVersionOf","scheme":"doi"}],"relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"2638051"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"2638050"}}]},"resource_type":{"title":"Presentation","type":"presentation"},"title":"Using citizen science to improve society and empower autistic people"},"owners":[19133],"revision":2,"stats":{"downloads":26.0,"unique_downloads":20.0,"unique_views":102.0,"version_downloads":26.0,"version_unique_downloads":20.0,"version_unique_views":102.0,"version_views":113.0,"version_volume":76799554.0,"views":113.0,"volume":76799554.0},"updated":"2019-04-13T01:33:12.479198+00:00"},{"conceptrecid":"989864","created":"2017-09-24T03:32:01.104735+00:00","doi":"10.3897/rio.2.e11563.figure5","files":[{"bucket":"8373b186-d35b-4b43-86ba-74c134a740e9","checksum":"md5:815ba4ab1926254c7fda7293051e6079","key":"oo_99271.jpg","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/8373b186-d35b-4b43-86ba-74c134a740e9/oo_99271.jpg"},"size":78153,"type":"jpg"}],"id":989865,"links":{"badge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.3897/rio.2.e11563.figure5.svg","bucket":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/8373b186-d35b-4b43-86ba-74c134a740e9","doi":"https://doi.org/10.3897/rio.2.e11563.figure5","html":"https://zenodo.org/record/989865","latest":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/989865","latest_html":"https://zenodo.org/record/989865","self":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/989865","thumb250":"https://zenodo.org/api/iiif/v2/8373b186-d35b-4b43-86ba-74c134a740e9:4d892df4-616f-4dfe-839e-d5db7f224aaa:oo_99271.jpg/full/250,/0/default.jpg"},"metadata":{"access_right":"open","access_right_category":"success","creators":[{"affiliation":"University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia","name":"Runnel, Veljo"},{"affiliation":"Museum f\u00fcr Naturkunde Berlin, Leibniz Institute for Evolution and Biodiversity Science, Berlin, Germany","name":"Wetzel, Florian"},{"affiliation":"Agentschap Plantentuin Meise, Meise, Belgium","name":"Groom, Quentin"},{"affiliation":"Norwegian Biodiversity Information Centre, Trondheim, Norway","name":"Koch, Wouter"},{"affiliation":"GlueCAD, Haifa, Israel","name":"Pe'er, Israel"},{"affiliation":"Norwegian Biodiversity Information Centre, Trondheim, Norway","name":"Valland, Nils"},{"affiliation":"Hellenic Centre for Marine Research (HCMR), Heraklion, Greece","name":"Panteri, Emmanouela"},{"affiliation":"University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia","name":"K\u00f5ljalg, Urmas"}],"description":"Figure 5 - \n        Biodiversity observation - from observation to data usage","doi":"10.3897/rio.2.e11563.figure5","keywords":["citizen science","biodiversity observations","volunteering","motivation","data","data sharing","policy"],"license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"publication_date":"2016-12-22","related_identifiers":[{"identifier":"10.3897/rio.2.e11563","relation":"isPartOf","scheme":"doi"}],"relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"989865"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"989864"}}]},"resource_type":{"subtype":"figure","title":"Figure","type":"image"},"title":"Figure 5 from: Runnel V, Wetzel F, Groom Q, Koch W, Pe'er I, Valland N, Panteri E, K\u00f5ljalg U (2016) Summary report and strategy recommendations for EU citizen science gateway for biodiversity data.

Malaysia is a biodiversity hotspot in the heart of Southeast Asia with roughly the same number of mammal species, three times the number of butterfly species, but only 4% of the land area of Australia. Consequently, in Malaysia, there is an urgent need for biodiversity monitoring and also public engagement with wildlife to raise awareness of biodiversity loss. Citizen science is \"on the rise\" globally and can make valuable contributions to long-term biodiversity monitoring, but perhaps more importantly, involving the general public in science projects can raise public awareness and promote engagement. Butterflies are often the focus of citizen science projects due to their charisma and familiarity and are particularly valuable \"ambassadors\" of biodiversity conservation for public outreach.</p>\n\n  <p>Here we present the data from our citizen science project, the first \"Peninsular Malaysia Butterfly Count\". Participants were asked to go outdoors on June 6, 2015, and (non-lethally) sample butterfly legs for species identification through DNA barcoding. Fifty-seven citizens responded to our adverts and registered to take part in the butterfly count with many registering on behalf of groups. Collectively the participants sampled 220 butterfly legs from 26 mostly urban and suburban sampling localities. These included our university campus, a highschool, several public parks and private residences. On the basis of 192 usable DNA barcodes, 43 species were sampled by the participants. The most sampled species was <i>Appias olferna</i>, followed by <i>Junonia orithya</i> and <i>Zizina otis</i>. Twenty-two species were only sampled once, five were only sampled twice, and four were only sampled three times. Three DNA barcodes could not be assigned species names. The sampled butterflies revealed that widely distributed, cosmopolitan species, often those recently arrived to the peninsula or with documented \"invasive\" potential, dominated the habitat types sampled by the participants. Data from this first Butterfly Count helps establish a baseline from which we can monitor the patterns and changes in butterfly communities in Peninsular Malaysia.</p>","doi":"10.3897/BDJ.3.e7159","imprint":{"publisher":"Pensoft Publishers"},"journal":{"issue":"","pages":"e7159","title":"Biodiversity Data Journal","volume":"3"},"keywords":["DNA

Data collected from different devices and by different untrained divers must have good estimation of the position where the information has been acquired. With this goal, in the context of the Green Bubbles project, a novel platform, called DocuScooter has been designed and developed. DocuScooter implements all the algorithms to filter and merge data with correct timestamp and position preparing the complete mission report. After the mission, the diver can upload the report on an appropriate web service to produce a 3D documentation. In order to obtain the underwater position during the dive, a tailored device compatible with the platform is also presented. Result of the prototype of the platform and the first results of the position estimation algorithm are presented and discussed.</p>","doi":"10.15406/iratj.2017.02.00010","grants":[{"acronym":"GreenBubbles","code":"643712","funder":{"acronyms":["EC"],"doi":"10.13039/501100000780","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/funders/10.13039/501100000780"},"name":"European Commission"},"links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/grants/10.13039/501100000780::643712"},"program":"H2020","title":"Green Bubbles RISE for sustainable diving"}],"journal":{"issue":"1","pages":"00010","title":"International Robotics & Automation Journal","volume":"2"},"keywords":["Citizen Science","Underwater robotics","Underwater positioning systems","Marine documentation","European Union (EU)","Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions","Grant Agreement No 643712","Green Bubbles RISE for sustainable diving","Green Bubbles"],"license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"notes":"This paper has received funding from the European Union (EU)'s H2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant agreement No 643712 to the project Green Bubbles RISE for sustainable diving (Green Bubbles).

This choice has potential trade-offs related to spatial scale, observer variance, and inter-annual variability. Here we explored this issue with phenology by comparing models built using data from the large-scale, citizen science National Phenology Network (NPN) effort with models built using data from more intensive studies at Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) sites. We built process based phenology models for species common to each dataset. From these models we compared parameter estimates, estimates of phenological events, and out-of-sample errors between models derived from both NPN and LTER data. We found that model parameter estimates for the same species were most similar between the two datasets when using simple models, but parameter estimates varied widely as model complexity increased. Despite this, estimates for the date of phenological events and out-of-sample errors were similar, regardless of the model chosen. Predictions for NPN data had the lowest error when using models built from the NPN data, while LTER predictions were best made using LTER-derived models, confirming that models perform best when applied at the same scale they were built. Accordingly, the choice of dataset depends on the research question. Inferences about species-specific phenological requirements are best made with LTER data, and if NPN or similar data are all that is available, then analyses should be limited to simple models. Large-scale predictive modeling is best done with the larger-scale NPN data, which has high spatial representation and a large regional species pool. LTER datasets, on the other hand, have high site fidelity and thus characterize inter-annual variability extremely well. Future research aimed at forecasting phenology events for particular species over larger scales should develop models which integrate the strengths of both datasets.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.1256705","license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"publication_date":"2018-05-31","references":[],"related_identifiers":[{"identifier":"10.1101/335802","relation":"isCitedBy","scheme":"doi"},{"identifier":"10.5281/zenodo.1256704","relation":"isVersionOf","scheme":"doi"}],"relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1256705"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1256704"}}]},"resource_type":{"subtype":"article","title":"Journal article","type":"publication"},"title":"Comparison of large-scale citizen science data and long-term study data for phenology modeling","version":"1"},"owners":[40436],"revision":4,"stats":{"downloads":4.0,"unique_downloads":4.0,"unique_views":49.0,"version_downloads":4.0,"version_unique_downloads":4.0,"version_unique_views":49.0,"version_views":52.0,"version_volume":2154439668.0,"views":52.0,"volume":2154439668.0},"updated":"2019-04-09T13:47:39.517032+00:00"},{"conceptdoi":"10.5281/zenodo.2643307","conceptrecid":"2643307","created":"2019-04-17T10:52:44.154594+00:00","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.2643308","files":[{"bucket":"908092d9-251f-40e6-bf10-4d6cebb37f1c","checksum":"md5:c0a6428476ca7f00309861bebf3458c6","key":"Open Hardware_Andre Maia Chagas.pdf","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/908092d9-251f-40e6-bf10-4d6cebb37f1c/Open%20Hardware_Andre%20Maia%20Chagas.pdf"},"size":18702580,"type":"pdf"},{"bucket":"908092d9-251f-40e6-bf10-4d6cebb37f1c","checksum":"md5:0167a181471fc62e4fe196fc0604ce45","key":"videopodcast (1).mp4","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/908092d9-251f-40e6-bf10-4d6cebb37f1c/videopodcast%20%281%29.mp4"},"size":2178173770,"type":"mp4"}],"id":2643308,"links":{"badge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.2643308.svg","bucket":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/908092d9-251f-40e6-bf10-4d6cebb37f1c","conceptbadge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.2643307.svg","conceptdoi":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2643307","doi":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2643308","html":"https://zenodo.org/record/2643308","latest":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/2643308","latest_html":"https://zenodo.org/record/2643308","self":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/2643308"},"metadata":{"access_right":"open","access_right_category":"success","communities":[{"id":"datastewards"}],"creators":[{"affiliation":"University of Sussex","name":"Chagas, Andre Maia","orcid":"0000-0003-2609-3017"}],"description":"<p><strong>Designing Open Hardware for </strong><strong>21st century</strong><strong> science&nbsp;</strong> - talk given by Andre Maia Chagas on 10 April 2019 at TU Delft.

Belgium is a typical polylingual country at the boundary between the Romance and Franconian languages (French, Dutch &amp; German).

There is also considerable scope for expansion into other countries and languages. Therefore, should we continue to expand? Volunteers give their time for free, but the creation and maintenance of the platform is not without costs. Given a finite budget, what can you get for your money? How does the quality compare with other methods?
