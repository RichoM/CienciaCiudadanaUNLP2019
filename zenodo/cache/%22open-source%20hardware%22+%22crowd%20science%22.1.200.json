practical elements of best practice and possible improvements in science and music education. The Conductive Music program incorporates public engagement principles, open-source hardware, DIY ethos, contemporary composition techniques, and educational activities for creative and analytical thinking. These activities impart positive skills through multi-media content delivery for all learning types. The program is designed to test practices for engaging at-risk young people from urban areas in the construction and performance of new electronic instruments. The goal is to open up the world of electronic music performance to a new generation of young digital artists and to replace negative social behaviours with creative outlets for expression through technology and performance. This paper highlights the key elements designed to deliver the program's agenda and examines the ways in which these aims were realised or tested in the classroom.","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.1178921","license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"meeting":{"place":"London, United Kingdom","title":"International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression"},"part_of":{"pages":"517--520","title":"Proceedings of the International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression"},"publication_date":"2014-06-01","related_identifiers":[{"identifier":"10.5281/zenodo.1178920","relation":"isVersionOf","scheme":"doi"}],"relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1178921"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1178920"}}]},"resource_type":{"subtype":"conferencepaper","title":"Conference paper","type":"publication"},"title":"Conductive Music: Teaching Innovative Interface Design and Composition Techniques with Open-Source Hardware"},"owners":[42081],"revision":3,"stats":{"downloads":2.0,"unique_downloads":2.0,"unique_views":2.0,"version_downloads":2.0,"version_unique_downloads":2.0,"version_unique_views":2.0,"version_views":2.0,"version_volume":1264500.0,"views":2.0,"volume":1264500.0},"updated":"2018-06-28T12:03:29.539956+00:00"},{"conceptrecid":"2409295","created":"2018-12-19T05:31:59.456227+00:00","doi":"10.3897/rio.4.e31701","files":[{"bucket":"6c101f71-8eaa-4759-a384-ca579480634f","checksum":"md5:a0244c728ce0d86c86f7cda97b7c13aa","key":"RIO_article_31701.pdf","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/6c101f71-8eaa-4759-a384-ca579480634f/RIO_article_31701.pdf"},"size":62968,"type":"pdf"},{"bucket":"6c101f71-8eaa-4759-a384-ca579480634f","checksum":"md5:f3eab9ee77053d092b7505190a02ceb0","key":"RIO_article_31701.xml","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/6c101f71-8eaa-4759-a384-ca579480634f/RIO_article_31701.xml"},"size":27336,"type":"xml"}],"id":2409296,"links":{"badge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.3897/rio.4.e31701.svg","bucket":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/6c101f71-8eaa-4759-a384-ca579480634f","doi":"https://doi.org/10.3897/rio.4.e31701","html":"https://zenodo.org/record/2409296","latest":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/2409296","latest_html":"https://zenodo.org/record/2409296","self":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/2409296"},"metadata":{"access_right":"open","access_right_category":"success","creators":[{"affiliation":"School of Computing, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom|Centre for Mind/Brain Science (CIMeC), University of Trento, Trento, Italy","name":"Monachino, Simone"},{"affiliation":"International Max Planck Research School, University of T\u00fcbingen, T\u00fcbingen, Germany","name":"McDermott, Eric James"},{"affiliation":"School of Life Sciences, University of Sussex, Brighton, United Kingdom","name":"Maia Chagas, Andre"}],"description":"<p>The first edition of the Aspects of Neuroscience Brainhack took place at the Department of Physics at University of Warsaw, Poland between November 17th and 19th 2017.

MOM combines a real-time signal processing engine implemented with Pure Data on an embedded Linux platform, with gestural interaction implemented via a variety of analog and digital sensors. Power, sound-input and sound-diffusion subsystems make the instrument autonomous and mobile. This instrument was designed in coordination with the development of an evening-length dance/music performance in which the performing musician is engaged in choreographed movements with the mobile instruments. The design methodology relied on a participatory process that engaged an interdisciplinary team made up of technologists, musicians, composers, choreographers, and dancers. The prototyping process relied on a mix of in-house and out-sourced digital fabrication processes intended to make the open source hardware and software design of the system accessible and affordable for other creators.","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.1302681","license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"meeting":{"place":"Blacksburg, Virginia, USA","title":"International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression"},"part_of":{"pages":"65--71","title":"Proceedings of the International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression"},"publication_date":"2018-06-01","related_identifiers":[{"identifier":"10.5281/zenodo.1302680","relation":"isVersionOf","scheme":"doi"}],"relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1302681"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1302680"}}]},"resource_type":{"subtype":"conferencepaper","title":"Conference paper","type":"publication"},"title":"MOM: an Extensible Platform for Rapid Prototyping and Design of Electroacoustic Instruments"},"owners":[42081],"revision":2,"stats":{"downloads":10.0,"unique_downloads":8.0,"unique_views":9.0,"version_downloads":10.0,"version_unique_downloads":8.0,"version_unique_views":9.0,"version_views":9.0,"version_volume":56310900.0,"views":9.0,"volume":56310900.0},"updated":"2018-07-01T16:53:43.158722+00:00"},{"conceptdoi":"10.5281/zenodo.2564075","conceptrecid":"2564075","created":"2019-02-13T19:56:16.909234+00:00","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.2564076","files":[{"bucket":"945faa6e-f6f9-4b66-9293-febfb2015b79","checksum":"md5:fbc2e49d3e91b38b6bc9b42ef9ffd607","key":"OSH Berlin Meetup 2019-02-06.pdf","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/945faa6e-f6f9-4b66-9293-febfb2015b79/OSH%20Berlin%20Meetup%202019-02-06.pdf"},"size":9633782,"type":"pdf"}],"id":2564076,"links":{"badge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.2564076.svg","bucket":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/945faa6e-f6f9-4b66-9293-febfb2015b79","conceptbadge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.2564075.svg","conceptdoi":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2564075","doi":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2564076","html":"https://zenodo.org/record/2564076","latest":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/2564076","latest_html":"https://zenodo.org/record/2564076","self":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/2564076"},"metadata":{"access_right":"open","access_right_category":"success","communities":[{"id":"cshl"}],"creators":[{"affiliation":"Institute for Globally Distributed Open Research and Education (IGDORE)","name":"Havemann, Johanna","orcid":"0000-0002-6157-1494"}],"description":"<p>Presentation about Open Science Hardware held at the <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/Berlin-Open-Science-Meetup/events/258563559/\">Berlin Open Science - Reproducible Research</a> - Meetup on Feb 06, 2019.</p>","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.2564076","keywords":["Open Science Hardware","Open Source Hardware"],"language":"eng","license":{"id":"CC-BY-1.0"},"publication_date":"2019-02-13","references":["Maia Chagas A (2018) Haves and have nots must find a better way: The case for open scientific hardware.

Embodying this design approach, the Monome OSC/MIDI USB controller represents a minimalist, open-source hardware device. The open-source nature of the device has allowed for a small group of Monome users to modify the hardware, firmware, and software associated with the interface. These user driven modifications have allowed the re-imagining of the interface for new and novel purposes, beyond even that of the device's original intentions. With development being driven by a community of users, a device can become several related but unique generations of musical controllers, each one focused on a specific set of needs.","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.1177919","license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"meeting":{"place":"Sydney, Australia","title":"International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression"},"part_of":{"pages":"1--6","title":"Proceedings of the International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression"},"publication_date":"2010-06-01","related_identifiers":[{"identifier":"10.5281/zenodo.1177918","relation":"isVersionOf","scheme":"doi"}],"relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1177919"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1177918"}}]},"resource_type":{"subtype":"conferencepaper","title":"Conference paper","type":"publication"},"title":"A Shift Towards Iterative and Open-Source Design for Musical Interfaces"},"owners":[42081],"revision":4,"stats":{"downloads":3.0,"unique_downloads":3.0,"unique_views":2.0,"version_downloads":3.0,"version_unique_downloads":3.0,"version_unique_views":2.0,"version_views":2.0,"version_volume":4457505.0,"views":2.0,"volume":4457505.0},"updated":"2018-12-07T14:17:13.175971+00:00"},{"conceptdoi":"10.5281/zenodo.3277274","conceptrecid":"3277274","created":"2019-07-09T16:53:16.459161+00:00","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.3277275","files":[{"bucket":"b20bac8f-844b-431a-bf66-0f26ac27bda3","checksum":"md5:10fa69026cb2c57ec5bd4d426d0cf05b","key":"paper4.pdf","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/b20bac8f-844b-431a-bf66-0f26ac27bda3/paper4.pdf"},"size":1240644,"type":"pdf"}],"id":3277275,"links":{"badge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.3277275.svg","bucket":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/b20bac8f-844b-431a-bf66-0f26ac27bda3","conceptbadge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.3277274.svg","conceptdoi":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3277274","doi":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3277275","html":"https://zenodo.org/record/3277275","latest":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/3277275","latest_html":"https://zenodo.org/record/3277275","self":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/3277275"},"metadata":{"access_right":"open","access_right_category":"success","communities":[{"id":"studiahumanitatis"}],"creators":[{"affiliation":"Pontificia Universidad Cat\u00f3lica del Ecuador, sede Santo Domingo, Ecuador","name":"Azcona Esteban, Jon","orcid":"0000-0002-7325-9553"},{"affiliation":"Pontificia Universidad Cat\u00f3lica del Ecuador, sede Santo Domingo, Ecuador","name":"Bonilla Bravo, Gonzalo Gabriel","orcid":"0000-0002-0717-0921"},{"affiliation":"Pontificia Universidad Cat\u00f3lica del Ecuador, sede Santo Domingo, Ecuador","name":"Ocampo Pazos, Willian Javier","orcid":"0000-0002-1100-2859"},{"affiliation":"Pontificia Universidad Cat\u00f3lica del Ecuador, sede Santo Domingo, Ecuador","name":"Ulloa Meneses, Luis Javier","orcid":"0000-0003-1568-1665"}],"description":"<p>Currently, experimentation is essential in the educational process.

With the availability of internet access the energy data can be read quickly and easily through user&rsquo;s smartphone without using any wires to PC or remote devices. It is based on open source hardware ie ESP-12E and ACS712. This smart meter uses ACS 721 current sensor to detect the current. NodeMCU take most important data such as voltage, current, and active power so that all further calculations can be made by the center of the system.

This project includes a complete, step-by-step video tutorial to demonstrate the assembly of the COSplayer [@cosplayer], a free and open source hardware device which serves as the reference implementation for the technology.</p>","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.3338391","keywords":["fMRI","stimulus-evoked","stimulation relay","TTL","BNC","pyboard","real-time","millisecond-accuracy","microsecond-accuracy","experiment support","psychophysics","Python","FOSS","BIDS","brain imaging data structure","magnetic resonance imaging","optogenetics","stimulation hardware","stimulus train","contrast optimized stimulation player","data acquisition","Bruker","ParaVision"],"license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"publication_date":"2019-07-16","related_identifiers":[{"identifier":"https://github.com/IBT-FMI/COSplay","relation":"isPartOf","scheme":"url"},{"identifier":"10.5281/zenodo.3338390","relation":"isVersionOf","scheme":"doi"}],"relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"3338391"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"3338390"}}]},"resource_type":{"title":"Software","type":"software"},"title":"COSplay: Contrast Optimized Stimulation Player","version":"1.1.2"},"owners":[25355],"revision":2,"stats":{"downloads":5.0,"unique_downloads":3.0,"unique_views":10.0,"version_downloads":5.0,"version_unique_downloads":3.0,"version_unique_views":10.0,"version_views":12.0,"version_volume":665370.0,"views":12.0,"volume":665370.0},"updated":"2019-07-16T19:05:49.547523+00:00"},{"conceptdoi":"10.5281/zenodo.1482778","conceptrecid":"1482778","created":"2018-11-11T05:07:18.259617+00:00","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.1482779","files":[{"bucket":"9837c912-0ce1-46cc-b261-2e7dda9e35c6","checksum":"md5:f61558b5945e72454c104c4759d3ca15","key":"OficialConferencePaper-Fab13.pdf","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/9837c912-0ce1-46cc-b261-2e7dda9e35c6/OficialConferencePaper-Fab13.pdf"},"size":377451,"type":"pdf"}],"id":1482779,"links":{"badge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.1482779.svg","bucket":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/9837c912-0ce1-46cc-b261-2e7dda9e35c6","conceptbadge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.1482778.svg","conceptdoi":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1482778","doi":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1482779","html":"https://zenodo.org/record/1482779","latest":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/1482779","latest_html":"https://zenodo.org/record/1482779","self":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/1482779"},"metadata":{"access_right":"open","access_right_category":"success","creators":[{"affiliation":"Cayetano Heredia University","name":"David Chaupis-Meza","orcid":"0000-0002-6388-163X"}],"description":"<p><strong>Abstract </strong></p>\n\n<p>Information is power, but how is this power distributed in our society? It is a fact that the distribution of information (the public knowledge) is not equal for all of us. Conventionally, this is called inequality of educational opportunity. Currently, we are living within&nbsp;the impact of such inequality, also&nbsp;with the globalization phenomenon, which has left us inside of a global crisis (the most important capitalist crisis since World War II). Nevertheless, we have&nbsp;the community forces.

The Mayfly Logger can be programmed using standard Arduino code and community libraries via the Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE) software or the more powerful PlatformIO IDE. The Mayfly Logger features the ATmega1284p processor, which has 4 times more flash memory for sketches, 8 times more RAM, and almost twice as many input pins as the ATmega328p chip found in the most common Arduino boards. The Mayfly Data Logger also has an integrated solar lipo battery charger, a precise real time clock (RTC), a microSD memory card socket, an XBee radio module socket, and other <a href=\"https://www.envirodiy.org/mayfly/hardware/features/\">hardware features</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Our <a href=\"https://github.com/EnviroDIY/EnviroDIY_Mayfly_Logger\">EnviroDIY_Mayfly_Logger Github repository</a> provides hardware design files and example code sketches, the <a href=\"https://www.envirodiy.org/\">EnviroDIY community</a> provides support via project posts and forums, and the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=envirodiy\">Mayfly Logger board is available for purchase on on Amazon</a> for user convenience.</p>\n\n<p><strong>New features of version 0.5b</strong> (released in May 2017):</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Added additional power options for the XBee radio socket, via jumper SJ13, to optionally power newer radios (i.e. 4G LTE-M &amp; NBIoT) that require up to 2A of power at ~3.7V and do not have an external JST power socket.
