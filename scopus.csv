NO,Personal food computer: A new device for controlled-environment agriculture,"Due to their interdisciplinary nature, devices for controlled-environment agriculture have the possibility to turn into ideal tools not only to conduct research on plant phenology but also to create curricula in a wide range of disciplines. Controlled-environment devices are increasing their functionalities as well as improving their accessibility. Traditionally, building one of these devices from scratch implies knowledge in fields such as mechanical engineering, digital electronics, programming, and energy management. However, the requirements of an effective controlled-environment device for personal use brings new constraints and challenges. This paper presents the OpenAg™ Personal Food Computer (PFC); a low cost desktop size platform, which not only targets plant phenology researchers but also hobbyists, makers, and teachers from elementary to high-school levels (K-12). The PFC is completely open-source and it is intended to become a tool that can be used for collective data sharing and plant growth analysis. Thanks to its modular design, the PFC can be used in a large spectrum of activities. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.",Agricultural robotics; Citizen science; Controlled-environment agriculture; Decentralised farming; Educational robotics; Open-source hardware; Open-source software,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85055903860&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-02683-7_79&partnerID=40&md5=932c7dacf3c02a6226cc85b79b7a8fa0,10.1007/978-3-030-02683-7_79,"Castelló Ferrer E., Rye J., Brander G., Savas T., Chambers D., England H., Harper C.",2019,Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing,881,,,1077,1096,,,Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85055903860
SI,A comprehensive IoT node proposal using open hardware. A smart farming use case to monitor vineyards,"The last decade has witnessed a significant reduction in prices and an increased performance of electronic components, coupled with the influence of the shift towards the generation of open resources, both in terms of knowledge (open access), programs (open-source software), and components (open hardware). This situation has produced different effects in today’s society, among which is the empowerment of citizens, called makers, who are themselves able to generate citizen science or build assembly developments. Situated in the context described above, the current study follows a Do-It-Yourself (DIY) approach. In this way, it attempts to define a conceptual design of an Internet of Things (IoT) node, which is reproducible at both physical and behavioral levels, to build IoT nodes which can cover any scenario. To test this conceptual design, this study proposes a sensorization node to monitor meteorological phenomena. The node is called SEnviro (node) and features different improvements such as: the possibility of remote updates using Over-the-Air (OTA) updates; autonomy, using 3G connectivity, a solar panel, and applied energy strategies to prolong its life; and replicability, because it is made up of open hardware and other elements such as 3D-printed pieces. The node is validated in the field of smart agriculture, with the aim of monitoring different meteorological phenomena, which will be used as input to disease detection models to detect possible diseases within vineyards. © 2018 by the authors.

SI,POSEIDON - Passive-acoustic ocean sensor for entertainment and interactive data-gathering in opportunistic nautical-activities,"Recent years demonstrate an increased interest in low-cost Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM) in citizen science for ecological monitoring and environmental protection. However, most efforts have targeted land use, leaving ocean and nautical applications greatly unexplored. In this paper we present the design, deployment and testing of POSEIDON, a low-cost PAM system for nautical citizen science and real-time acoustic augmentation of whale-watching experiences. POSEIDON uses machine learning techniques to identify vocal acoustic samples of common cetaceans like whales and dolphins. When discriminating the calls, we find that Extra Trees and Gradient Boosting outperform other classifiers (>0.95 confidence threshold). The features extracted from the machine learning models are used to enhance the whale watching experience and provide citizen science data to marine biologists and environmental protection agencies. While this paper focuses on the design of the system, future work will focus on user testing and widespread deployment of open-hardware and software for nautical PAM applications. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.",Cetaceans; Citizen science; IoT; Machine learning; Ocean GUI; Passive acoustic monitoring; Whale-watching,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054008384&doi=10.1145%2f3196709.3196752&partnerID=40&md5=70f43c2d0036c6dc0164a6cd3a500afc,10.1145/3196709.3196752,"Radeta M., Nunes N.J., Vasconcelos D., Nisi V.",2018,DIS 2018 - Proceedings of the 2018 Designing Interactive Systems Conference,,,,999,1012,,1,Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85054008384
SI,Public Lab: Community-Based Approaches to Urban and Environmental Health and Justice,"This paper explores three cases of Do-It-Yourself, open-source technologies developed within the diverse array of topics and themes in the communities around the Public Laboratory for Open Technology and Science (Public Lab). These cases focus on aerial mapping, water quality monitoring and civic science practices. The techniques discussed have in common the use of accessible, community-built technologies for acquiring data. They are also concerned with embedding collaborative and open source principles into the objects, tools, social formations and data sharing practices that emerge from these inquiries. The focus is on developing processes of collaborative design and experimentation through material engagement with technology and issues of concern. Problem-solving, here, is a tactic, while the strategy is an ongoing engagement with the problem of participation in its technological, social and political dimensions especially considering the increasing centralization and specialization of scientific and technological expertise. The authors also discuss and reflect on the Public Lab’s approach to civic science in light of ideas and practices of citizen/civic veillance, or “sousveillance”, by emphasizing people before data, and by investigating the new ways of seeing and doing that this shift in perspective might provide. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.",Aerial mapping; Civic science; Community engagement; Do-It-Yourself; Open hardware; Open source; Participatory design; Sousveillance; Water quality,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85046495122&doi=10.1007%2fs11948-018-0059-8&partnerID=40&md5=9468998e5d583eaed355a93a0c496d9b,10.1007/s11948-018-0059-8,"Rey-Mazón P., Keysar H., Dosemagen S., D’Ignazio C., Blair D.",2018,Science and Engineering Ethics,24,3,,971,997,,1,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85046495122
SI,An Open Framework for Participatory PM2.5 Monitoring in Smart Cities,"As the population in cities continues to increase rapidly, air pollution becomes a serious issue from public health to social economy. Among all pollutants, fine particulate matters (PM2.5) directly related to various serious health concerns, e.g., lung cancer, premature death, asthma, and cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. To enhance the quality of urban living, sensors are deployed to create smart cities. In this paper, we present a participatory urban sensing framework for PM2.5 monitoring with more than 2500 devices deployed in Taiwan and 29 other countries. It is one of the largest deployment project for PM2.5 monitor in the world as we know until May 2017. The key feature of the framework is its open system architecture, which is based on the principles of open hardware, open source software, and open data. To facilitate the deployment of the framework, we investigate the accuracy issue of low-cost particle sensors with a comprehensive set of comparison evaluations to identify the most reliable sensor. By working closely with government authorities, industry partners, and maker communities, we can construct an effective eco-system for participatory urban sensing of PM2.5 particles. Based on our deployment achievements to date, we provide a number of data services to improve environmental awareness, trigger on-demand responses, and assist future government policymaking. The proposed framework is highly scalable and sustainable with the potential to facilitate the Internet of Things, smart cities, and citizen science in the future. © 2013 IEEE.",Air pollution; crowdsourcing; environmental monitoring; Internet of Things,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85023185030&doi=10.1109%2fACCESS.2017.2723919&partnerID=40&md5=ae7a4b94de4a663a81199bb5ff1341b3,10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2723919,"Chen L.-J., Ho Y.-H., Lee H.-C., Wu H.-C., Liu H.-M., Hsieh H.-H., Huang Y.-T., Lung S.-C.C.",2017,IEEE Access,5,,7970115,14441,14454,,27,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85023185030
SI,Citizen science in high-latitude ecosystems: Kduino buoy to support data gathering in extreme environments,"KdUINO buoy, a moored citizen science system with low-cost sensors is based on the open hardware platform Arduino and quasi digital optical light sensors that measure a parameter related to water transparency, the diffuse attenuation coefficient. The buoy also has a real-time clock and an SD memory card to save data and the time of the measurements. Volunteers tested KdUINOs in Canada and Antarctica. They did some preliminary tests with KdUINOs where they compared light diffuse attenuation coefficient between Ramsey Lake and Lake Laurentian. Ramsey Lake has depths up to 100 m, a diverse population of fish and normal pH for the boreal region of Canada. KdUINO was deployed through fall freeze and left in place until spring melt through winter 2015, with atmospheric temperatures down to -20° C during the winter, and it worked properly under these freezing weather conditions. The preliminary tests concluded that Ramsey Lake was found to have a Kd about six times lower than Lake Laurentian, indicating, as expected, that Ramsey Lake is much more transparent than Lake Laurentian. In Antarctica, taking advantage of the annual research campaigns of the Hesperides vessel, a volunteer, who was a technician of the ship, made measurements using the KdUINO at 60° S and 61° S. The temperature of the water/air of the sampling points was 1.5° C and -2° C. light diffuse attenuation coefficient values obtained are within the expected values in this region.",,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85026670576&partnerID=40&md5=a5d7bb25ebbc6157c1899a4c64a29104,,"Bardaji R., Best M., Piera J.",2017,Sea Technology,58,2,,37,39,,,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85026670576
SI,Estimating the underwater diffuse attenuation coefficient with a low-cost instrument: The KdUINO DIY buoy,"A critical parameter to assess the environmental status of water bodies is the transparency of the water, as it is strongly affected by different water quality related components (such as the presence of phytoplankton, organic matter and sediment concentrations). One parameter to assess the water transparency is the diffuse attenuation coefficient. However, the number of subsurface irradiance measurements obtained with conventional instrumentation is relatively low, due to instrument costs and the logistic requirements to provide regular and autonomous observations. In recent years, the citizen science concept has increased the number of environmental observations, both in time and space. The recent technological advances in embedded systems and sensors also enable volunteers (citizens) to create their own devices (known as Do-It-Yourself or DIY technologies). In this paper, a DIY instrument to measure irradiance at different depths and automatically calculate the diffuse attenuation Kd coefficient is presented. The instrument, named KdUINO, is based on an encapsulated low-cost photonic sensor and Arduino (an open-hardware platform for the data acquisition). The whole instrument has been successfully operated and the data validated comparing the KdUINO measurements with the commercial instruments. Workshops have been organized with high school students to validate its feasibility. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Arduino; Buoy; Citizen science; Diffuse attenuation coefficient; Do-it-yourself; KdUINO; Light; Low-cost sensor; Oceanography,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84961249487&doi=10.3390%2fs16030373&partnerID=40&md5=8f707565c77f1681bd8d908910b2de48,10.3390/s16030373,"Bardaji R., Sánchez A.-M., Simon C., Wernand M.R., Piera J.",2016,Sensors (Switzerland),16,3,373,,,,10,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84961249487
NO,Position paper: Collaborative gamification design for scientific software,"Gamification, a design trend that is extensively applied to education and citizen science, is regarded as a means to improve scientific software usability. However, development and use of scientific software have special needs and characteristics that might present design challenges. Our position is that gamification and usability design for scientific software should be facilitated by an open, collaborative design process supported by conversational media. We believe this approach is compatible with qualities often attributed to computational science community regarding openness and collaboration between members of varied professional backgrounds. Through an illustrative scenario, we exemplify the use of conversational media for collaborative design. We expect the synergy between collaborators to result in better usability, greater user acceptance, and adequacy to requirements, obtaining optimal design solutions in a sustainable way. © 2016, CEUR-WS.

SI,Open source hardware (OSHW) supporting interaction between traditional crafts and emergent science: Wayang Kulit over microfluidic interfaces,"In this paper we will summarize our research into the use of Open Source Hardware (OSHW) as a tool for communicating emergent scientific and technical knowledge via crafts. We were specifically interested in the microfabrication and microfluidic devices, which define the next generation of diagnostic and research tools often inaccessible to the larger public, but also to the scientists from the Global South. We used the traditional wayang kulit theater (shadow puppets) as a model for building microfluidic interfaces, which communicate emergent scientific issues to the larger public while testing the possibilities for DIY microfluidics. This culture-centered approach to design and science communication supports open science and citizen science projects. The prototype of a microfluidic shadow puppets' theater is discussed in the context of previous and future OSHW and crafts prototypes, which support culture-centered design.

SI,Open design: Non-professional user-designers creating products for citizen science: A case study of Beekeepers,"Affiliated technologies have opened up opportunities for people, no matter what their design competency or expertise, to engage in the design of the products they use. The notion of ""Open Design"" or the open sharing of information relating to the design and manufacture of products, services or objects, can be seen as part of a much more encompassing phenomenon whereby users are the innovators and fabricators of their own products. Digital fabrication can enable the remote fabrication of objects tailoring artefacts to specific users or environmental needs. Open fabrication makes manufacturing processes accessible and can respond to niche needs with bespoke production. Citizen science uses non-professionals to conduct research in their own environment or location, extending the impact of research. This process of ""amateur scientist"" and community monitoring has positive and negative aspects that design can help to address. The workshop conducted as part of this research involved 15 amateur beekeepers and led to a probe study involving 150 participants in the UK, testing a new approach to co-collaboration yielding positive outcomes. The bee population is currently under threat from environmental change, pollution, disease and they are users with a specific interest, bespoke needs and a knowledge base outside of their profession. The decline in bees is a scientific issue as they are seen as a barometer for the health of the environment. Through analysis of observations and insights gained through active design-led workshops, this paper examines the potential barriers, opportunities, benefits and pitfalls of user-designers engaging with citizen science using open design and open fabrication tools. Workshop results included: methods, motivations, designer and manufacturer opportunities and insights into repeatable processes forming the start of a citizen science toolkit. The objective was to ascertain the possible pitfalls of a group of user-designers creating their own citizen science tools enabled by technologists and designers. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",beekeeping; citizen science; open design; open fabrication; User centred design; user-designers,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84880735893&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-642-39253-5_47&partnerID=40&md5=10e986fa63abca88c64d6571ff0807af,10.1007/978-3-642-39253-5_47,"Phillips R., Ford Y., Sadler K., Silve S., Baurley S.",2013,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),8015 LNCS,PART 4,,424,431,,2,Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84880735893
SI,Distributed Ground Station Network - A global system for tracking and communication with small satellites as an open,"Small satellite missions face two special challenges due to limited financial budgets. The first is tracking the satellite for orbit determination after orbit injection. The orbit can vary from the specified orbit when the satellite will be launched as secondary or parasitic payload. In case of unknown orbit parameters high-gain antennas can't be pointed towards the satellite and establish the first connection needed for satellite activation. The second challenge is to transmit all housekeeping and scientific data to mission operations via a limited number of ground-stations. The Distributed Ground Station Network (DGSN) solution can solve the problem with permanent tracking and a faster orbital element provision to the satellite owners. And it can provide permanent reception of satellite signals with its data-dump mode in between main ground-stations provided by the satellite owner. The key feature is the network of small ground-stations placed globally connected via the internet and performing an automatic scan of satellite (and other beacon) signals, storing and sending them back to a central server, where they can be accessed by the satellite owner. With a correlation of the beacon signal and GNSS synched ground-station time the satellite position is determined with pseudo-ranging trilateration. In contrast to ground-station time sharing concepts of Radio Aurora Explorer (SRI International in California and University of Michigan), AlSat (DLR) and QB50-GENSO (Karman Institute for Fluid Dynamics) that rely on a limited number of amateur radio operators and expensive hardware with limited availability DGSN uses an innovative citizen science approach. The participatory aspect includes the deployment of ground-station hardware and acquisition of satellite signal data but also the open-source hardware. In this way a high number of built sensornodes can be achieved and it also creates a new market for selling ready ground-stations. The network owners an open-platform for every small satellite operator with a faster access to tracking data than the update period by NORAD or ESTRACK with less running costs. The low data-rate reception is compensated by the global and permanent coverage. DGSN will offer the orbital parameters of the received satellite signal under a free license. The feasibility study had been conducted as part of Azorean observing VERDE Sat during the Small Satellite Project at the Institute of Space Systems (IRS) of the University of Stuttgart and DGSN is in the prototyping and testing phase of the ground-stations. ©2013 by the International Astronautical Federation.
